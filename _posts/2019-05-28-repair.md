## Emergency repairs

### Spoke Emergency Repair Kit
From discussions with other cyclists and reading numerous journals it sounds like one of the most 
common problems experienced during a bicycle tour are **broken or damaged spokes**.

The problem is often attributed to carrying too much weight on rims and spokes that aren't designed 
to carry the load, poor maintenance habits such as ignoring a untrued wheel too long or hitting a 
nasty and giant pothole at the wrong time and speed.

<!-- more -->

Regardless of how it happens it has to be fixed. If you ignore a broken spoke then over time the 
remaining spokes will break leaving you with a loaded bike with a broken wheel.

I take some Spoke repair parts along on tour with me. My kit consists of the following:

- Four spare regular spokes
- Two spare drivetrain side spokes
- Two FiberSpokes
- Spoke wrench
- Stein rear-cassette remover

To some people this equipment might seem like overkill especially since I've never had to use it. 
During my Round Lake Huron tour I met up with two Cross Canada cyclists who had plenty of tubes, 
tire patch kits and even spare tires but not a single spoke related repair item. At our last meal 
meeting place before we parted ways I gave them a Fiberspoke "just in case" since I already knew 
how common spoke problems can be from talking to others.

Later I heard from them via email that within four days of our parting, **four spokes broke on the 
rear wheel** of one bike. This happened in one of the more remote areas of their tour. After setting 
up the Fiberspoke they were able to ride through 75 km of forest to reach the next town with a 
bike shop where they replaced their spokes.

four regular spokes, two drivetrain spokes and a fiberspoke. The Fiberspoke packs away into the 
small cylinder shown in the picture.</figcaption>
</figure>


The Fiberspokes have the advantage of being light weight, small, relatively inexpensive and requiring 
almost no tools to use. You don't need to remove the rear cassette or anything else to get the bike 
working again. Often you can reuse the Fiberspoke many times as well. I like to think of the 
Fiberspoke as something I would use to allow me to finish the day's ride so that I can do a more 
permanent repair in the relative comfort of my campsite for the night although there have been 
reports in various tour journals of people successfully using fiberspokes to complete an entire tour.

More permanent repairs require having the correct spokes for your rims. These spokes are generally 
not too expensive and with the number you are likely to carry they will not add much weight. 
The hardest part about carrying them with you is that they are somewhat long in length making 
packing them a bit awkward.

A **spoke wrench** is needed to help with replacing the broken spoke. I initally carried the round 
spoke wrench shown in the first picture until I temporarily misplaced it just before leaving on 
a tour. I replaced it with a spoke wrench that's the exact size needed by the spokes. 
The rounded wrench supports many different spoke sizes making it an excellent general purpose 
tool but one mechanic that I spoke to said that it had more of a tendancy to round spoke ends 
then did the more specifically sized wrench that I use now.

Should the broken spoke be a rear wheel drive train side spoke then the repair job becomes 
trickier due to the need to remove the rear cassette in order to replace the spoke. There are 
heavier and bulkier tools available that are used by bike shop mechanics to do this but the 
extra weight and storage requirements make them less desirable to carry during a bicycle tour.

  <img src = "/public/images/{{page.slug}}/SteinCassetteRemover.jpg"  alt = "Stein Cassette Remover" />
  <figcaption>The Stein rear cassette remover.</figcaption>
</figure>

Thankfully there is a device called the **Stein rear cassette remover**. This device is compact and 
lightweight making removal of the rear cassette a relatively easy operation to perform.

Of course having all these tools available is really useless unless you also have the knowledge 
of how to use them. I will be adding more pages describing how to do these things but a very 
cost effective addition to your spoke repair kit would be some hands-on lessons with the 
mechanic in your local bicycle shop. Just remember that a broken bike in the middle of nowhere 
isn't likely what you want especially if the broken part is something as easily repaired as a 
spoke and pretour lessons take little time or cost.

While you are meeting up with the bicycle mechanic have them show you the basics of trueing a wheel. 
On tour you are not likely to have a trueing stand with you but you can often use the brake 
pads as a rough trueing guide provided you understand what you are doing from previous experience.



### Drivetrain Related Emergency repair gear

During my Round Lake Erie tour I experienced multiple problems with a very significant part of the 
drive train, the right pedal. I broke not one but two pedals in very different places during that tour. 
The first pedal likely broke from lots of use and a lack of proper maintenance and lubrication. 
The second pedal broke after less then two days of touring.

I learned from these adventures in many ways. The first lesson is that you really can't use ziplocks 
to help create a temporary fix for a broken pedal when it's the main attachment point that's broken. 
The second lesson was to take a second set of pedals and some maintenance gear with me during my next 
tour. I've been doing so ever since.

On this page I will mention some parts that I use for drive train maintenance. I don't take all of 
them with me on tour although most do come along. I'll specify what I don't take in the remainder 
as I describe each part.

#### Grease Gun
My first set of pedals likely disintegrated from a lack of lubrication and proper maintenance. 
I purchased another set of Eggbeater pedals to replace the ones that had broken. This new set 
had a feature lacking in the original pair, the ability to inject new grease into the pedals.

<figure class = "fig_leftimg">  
  <img src = "/public/images/{{page.slug}}/GreaseGun.jpg"  alt = "Grease Gun" />
  <figcaption>A picture of my grease gun attached to a tube of grease.</figcaption>
</figure>

Bob, my fellow touring buddy showed me a handy grease gun that he picked up from a local bike shop. 
This grease gun screws into a tube of grease and allows you to easily service the pedals from almost 
anywhere. Service consisted of simply removing the end cap from the pedal, attaching the piece to 
use for injecting the grease, place the grease gun into the adaptor and fill the pedal with grease until it comes out clean.
I experienced no problems with these pedals during my Round Lake Huron tour. I will continue to take this gear with me on tour.


#### Pedal wrench
<figure class = "fig_leftimg">  
  <img src = "/public/images/{{page.slug}}/PedalWrench.jpg"  alt = "Pedal Wrench" />
  <figcaption>Full sized pedal wrench.</figcaption>
</figure>

I haven't taken a pedal wrench on tour and I hope that I won't need to. I know that some people carry 
them on tours where they have to take the pedals off to ship the bike via airplane, train or bus. The 
Eggbeater pedals I use now connect using a allen key. About my only concern is that I will someday have 
problems removing a set of pedals with an allen key due to a lack of enough leverage. (One advantage of a 
full sized pedal wrench is that it makes removing stubborn pedals from a bike very easy due to it's 
increased leverage from it's extended length).


#### Chain Tool
I've broken a chain while cranking up a heavily snow covered hill during a bike commute to work. I've 
also broken the chain numerous times while mountain biking but I have so far not broken a chain while 
on tour. There have been a few reports of broken chains in touring journals.

<figure class = "fig_leftimg">  
  <img src = "/public/images/{{page.slug}}/ChainTool.jpg"  alt = "Chain Tool" />
  <figcaption>My Park chain tool with a useful piece of chain for practicing.</figcaption>
</figure>


Currently I have an Allen Multi-use tool that includes a **chain tool** that I usually take on tour. 
At home I use a Park Chain Tool for any chain work I do from removing the chain for cleaning 
through to putting a new chain on the bike.

It is important that when purchasing a new chain you find out if the pins in the chain can be reused 
after a chain tool has worked with them. In some cases the pin has to be replaced. One brand of chain 
that seems to require new pins is Shimano. Other chains have Masterlinks that allow easy removal and 
replacement of a chain without needing a chain tool. Of course if this type of chain breaks on tour 
then you still may need a chain tool.


### Emergency Repair Kit odd's and ends
This section discusses tools and spare parts that I like to carry with me on tour and haven't covered 
on any of the other sections. 

#### Spare bolts
<figure class = "fig_leftimg">  
  <img src = "/public/images/{{page.slug}}/SpareBolts.jpg"  alt = "Spare Bolts" />
  <figcaption>Spare bolts and an old film case to put them in</figcaption>
</figure>

It would really suck to get three quarters of the way through a tour only to discover that you've 
lost a critical bolt. In my case this happened to me during my Round Lake Huron tour when I lost one 
of the bolts in my rear rack. Luckily I was carrying a film canister with some spare bolts.


While this worked well to fix the problem I encountered another trick that experienced bicycle 
tourists use is to replace as many bolts as possible on the bike with one common size. 
An example of this techinique is replacing water bottle cage bolts with longer bolts and washers 
that can be used elsewhere on the bike should a problem occur.
<br><br><br>
#### Ziplock ties
<figure class = "fig_leftimg">  
  <img src = "/public/images/{{page.slug}}/ZiplockTies.jpg"  alt = "Ziplock Ties" />
  <figcaption>Ziplock ties can go a long way towards giving you a temporary fix to a critical problem.</figcaption>
</figure>

During my Round Lake Erie tour ziplock ties were successfully used to keep one of my Vaude rear 
saddlebags attached to the rack when the attachment mechanism failed at a bad time and place. 
Later on I removed the ziplock ties and fixed the problem with the attachment mechanism. 
Plastic tie wraps or zip lock ties are inexpensive and very useful for helping to temporarily fix problems that occurr during a tour.
<br><br><br>

#### Deraileur hanger
<figure class = "fig_leftimg">  
  <img src = "/public/images/{{page.slug}}/DerailleurHanger.jpg"  alt = "Derailleur Hanger" />
  <figcaption>Picture of a derailleur hanger.</figcaption>
</figure>
This is an item that is most likely to be needed during an offroad tour although having a fully 
loaded road touring bike fall over in a way that damages the derailleur hanger is possible. 
When a deraileur hanger is bent it often causes problems with shifting especially for indexed 
shifting systems. With some types of shifters you can sometimes work around the problem by using friction mode instead.

<br><br><br>

### Emergency Repair Kit - Multiple Function Tools
People often consider taking a multiple function tool along with them during a tour. I did this during both of my lake tours.

These kind of tools usually include a number of helpful parts that could really aid you in an 
emergency repair situation. The tool shown in the picture includes a chain tool, numerous allen 
keys, two tire levers, a couple screw drivers, a small pedal wrench and a knife as well as a number of other functions.


<figure>  
  <img src = "/public/images/{{page.slug}}/AlienMultitool.jpg"  alt = "Allen Multitool" />
  <figcaption>An example of a multiple function tool.</figcaption>
</figure>


All of this functionality has the potential to weigh more then the weight of just carrying a few 
specific tools that you will need with you during your tour. If you carefully review the number 
of allen key sizes that you actually have on your bike and standardize on as few sizes as possible 
then you might be able to go from carrying 5 or more allen keys as shown in the multiple function 
tool picture to carrying only one, two or three of the hex keys that you actually need.

Another example is the chain tool. The chain tool shown in the picture works fine and I have used 
it very successfully to fix a broken chain while mountain biking in the woods. I also have a 
Park Chain tool which I find much more comfortable to use primarily because it is a larger 
size that feels better in my hand. Either one works fine to fix a broken chain.

Looking over the rest of the tool I always carry separate tire levers with me anyway since 
I like to use three when working on the bike. I am unlikely to use the remaining tools.

A multiple function tool like the tool shown above can really be useful and helpful if it's 
the only tool available to you or if you want to carry a single tool that has lots of functionality 
to help you quickly resolve a problem. I carry one while mountain biking for exactly that reason. 
I cycle with others so I never really know what tools I might need in order to help them out.

During a bicycle tour most cyclists end up trying to think about how to carry less weight. 
One easy weight reduction is to carry only the tools that you actually need. With a bit of 
looking and careful planning you should be able to carry high quality tools that are comfortable 
to use while carrying less weight then a multiple function tool.


## Breaking or repairing the chain using a chain tool

I've never broken a chain while touring but based on some very early results from the Broken gear during 
a bicycle touring adventure poll it appears that some people have experienced this. I have broken my 
chain twice while off-road mountain biking and once while Icebiking on during my winter commute.

Last week my friend Jakub experienced a chain break during his commute home. Since I was riding with him 
I had the chance for a quick refresher course in repairing a broken chain.

<figure class = "fig_leftimg">  
  <img src = "/public/images/{{page.slug}}/ChainTool.jpg"  alt = "Chain Tool" />
  <figcaption>This is a picture of a Park Chain tool and a length of practice chain.</figcaption>
</figure>

Even if you never break a chain during a tour it's still a useful skill to have especially if you like 
to remove your chain and soak it in some chain cleaning material before reinstalling it back on the bike.

At the upper left is a picture showing a Park Chain tool and a short length of practice chain. 
The practice chain was obtained at my favourite local bike shop by simply asking if they had 
some spare chain lying around. It turns out that most shops do have extra so it's well worth 
asking for some so that you can practice your skills in advance.

The Park Chain tool shown in that picture is my preferred tool for working on my bike chains. 
There are numerous chain tools offered by a large number of manufacturers. Most have very similar 
features but differing levels of quality so it's well worth looking around to find one that matches your needs.

 
### Breaking the chain

<figure>  
  <img src = "/public/images/{{page.slug}}/ChainBreak.jpg"  alt = "Chain Break" />
  <figcaption>Two pictures showing how to break the chain.</figcaption>
</figure>

The picture above has two images related to breaking the chain. The leftmost image shows a 
picture of a SRAM chain. Notice the round circles visible in this picture. These circles are the 
actual pins that hold the various links together.

The second picture shows the chain placed in the chain tool. Notice that although there are two 
places where it appears that the chain could be placed in actual fact I have placed the chain at the rear most position.

The two positions serve different purposes. I use the rear position to push the pin in or out 
of the chain. The front position is used to remove tightness from the chain once the pin is placed back in the chain.

<figure class = "fig_rightimg">  
  <img src = "/public/images/{{page.slug}}/ChainBroken.jpg"  alt = "Chain Broken" />
  <figcaption>This is a picture of the freshly broken chain. Notice that the pin is not entirely pushed out of the chain.</figcaption>
</figure>

The picture to the right shows the chain in two pieces following the removal of the pin. 
Notice that I have purposely left the pin attached to the chain. I do this even for chains 
like those made by Shimano where you need to insert a new pin rather then reuse the existing one. 
It is vastly simplier to repair the chain later if you have a bit of pin already in the chain 
when you need to start pushing the pin in. If you have to replace the pin with a new one then 
you can easily push the old pin out using the new pin and the chain tool.


### Repairing the chain

The picture below contains two images showing the chain being put back together. This is a 
kind time to once again mention that some chains require you to replace the old pin with a new one 
whenever you do this operation. One brand where this is often the case is Shimano. When in doubt ask at your local bike shop.

<figure>  
  <img src = "/public/images/{{page.slug}}/ChainRepair.jpg"  alt = "Chain Repair" />
  <figcaption>Two images showing a chain being repaired.</figcaption>
</figure>

In the first picture the chain is once again in the rear most slot and I am pushing the pin back 
into the chain. When doing this I am careful to make sure that I only push the pin through so 
that it is flush with the other side of the chain.

Following the insertion of the pin the chain will often be quite tight in the location where you 
inserted the pin. It is important that you remove this tightness so that the chain can flow 
properly through the entire drivetrain without problem. The easiest solution to this is to 
insert the chain in the front slot and once again press against the pin. This action will 
spread the chain apart and remove the tightness in the process.

Double check the chain to make sure that the link is still firmly embedded in the chain. 
If this is the case then your repair is complete.

Keep in mind that if you had to remove one or more links then the chain is now shorter. 
You should use caution when using your lowest and highest gears. With the chain being 
shorter do not be surprised if you can not use some of them until you replace the missing length.





## Mini-tools
Many people carry mini-tools along with them during a bicycle tour. These tools often have 
some way of allowing you to work on your chain. You should definately try out the mini-tool 
using a piece of practice chain prior to your tour so that you can make sure that it works 
the way that you would like it to.
<figure class = "fig_leftimg">  
  <img src = "/public/images/{{page.slug}}/ChainMiniTool.jpg"  alt = "Chain Mini Tool" />
  <figcaption>My Allen mini-tool being used to work on a chain.</figcaption>
</figure>

The picture to the left shows me using my Allen mini-tool to work on a chain. As you can see 
there is a lot more bulk to the chain tool when using this option. The important thing is that 
with this tool I can indeed repair or break a chain. It is worth mentioning that I find the 
process easier and much more problem free when using a dedicated chain tool like the Park one shown earlier in the article.

Michel Gagnon added the following...

"For people who buy a 'new' chain tool or rejuvenate an old one, I learned on the road that 
there is a difference between a chain tool that is 9-speed compatible and one that isn't.

I can tell you that even today, some shops sell 7/8-speed chain tools. The difference lies in 
the section used to remove the tightness between links. If you have a 7/8 speed chain tool, 
the chain won't slide in there. Short of exchanging the tool for a new one, a very simple 
solution is to file slightly the two teeth upon which the chain sits but do it at home and not on the road!"

## Do It Yourself Needle Oiler
Peter Gordon is a member of the International Touring Bicycle Mailing List. He's put together a 
handy gadget to assist with bicycle maintenance.

For years, the SFR needle oiler has been my preferred method of chain and cable lubrication. It's 
main advantage is that only a small drop of oil is required on each link to lubricate it. 
This reduces the collection of grime on the chain considerably.

This product is no longer available on the Australian market, so I reverted to my previous favourite of 
Mobil 1 15W-50 oil thinned with about 10% penetrating oil. I soon found that I badly missed 
the needle oiler from SFR, so I made my own. As the result is far superior to the applicator supplier 
with any bike oil container and is cheap and easy to make, I thought that I would share it.

I bought a hypodermic needle, (not syringe) from a pharmacy. In the top of an old Tri-Flow bottle top, 
I cut off the top of the applicator and drilled a hole from the bottom side in the applicator. 
I then press fitted the hypodermic needle. I then used a 3 cornered file to cut off the sharp point of the needle. 
(First, I tried a side cutter, but this squeezed the needle closed.) The result can be viewed in the picture.

<figure>  
  <img src = "/public/images/{{page.slug}}/DIYNeedleOiler.jpg"  alt = "DIY Needle Oiler" />
  <figcaption>Peter's DIY Needle Oiler.</figcaption>
</figure>

This allows the delivery of a very small drop of oil to a precise location. 
The high quality synthetic oil and the penetrating oil work as well as the SFR product, and is much cheaper.

The method should be applicable to most bike oil containers. I used Mobil 1 because I had some. 
Any high quality synthetic engine oil should be suitable. Any liquid, (not aerosol), penetrating oil 
should be suitable. I used Penetrene, which is Australian made and, for me, is cheap and easy to obtain.
