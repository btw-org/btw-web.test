Now that you've read a bit about touring it's only natural to want to know about how you can get started.

This section of the website discusses how to go about getting started. 
It focuses on the things that you should consider about yourself like physical training, 
mental strength and then dives into topics like Keeping a Journal or Taking Pictures.
<!-- more -->
## Ok, Ok, OK! I'm interested. What does it take to get started?
Touring is a wonderful activity AND it's really not that hard to get out there and see the world on your bicycle.

In simplest terms it only takes a few things.

**1) You:**  
The first thing that comes to people's minds when you mention "you" is the requirement to actually pedal the bike. When you tour the turning of the pedals is just a detail. You are so much more then just the engine. You are also the main control center, the cook, the construction worker (setting up camp), the firestarter (lighting stoves and campfires) and many other things.
In short you are both the brains and brawn of the operation.

**2) The bicycle and related equipment:**  
It wouldn't be a bicycle tour without a bicycle now would it?
Of course a bicycle by itself usually isn't enough. You also need a way to carry your food, shelter, clothing and repair equipment.

**3) Shelters, cooking gear, clothing and other equipment not bicycle related:**  
Depending on the type of tour you are on, you will need a place to sleep, a way to prepare food (assuming it's hot food you are after) and some clothing to keep you protected from heat, cold and bugs (sometimes all on the same day).

**4) Logistics:**  
This category covers the multitude of little things that you get the opportunity to explore during a touring adventure.
Planning your route, getting you and your stuff to the starting point, being prepared for the weather, wild and bug life etc.
The pages that follow this one will go into much more detail for each of these pages. Read on to learn more.

### You! It's your muscles that run this operation. How do you prepare?
Let's start with the most important factor first, you.
People are very complex individuals and what works for one person may not work for another.
I think it is safe to break people down into two parts when considering a bicycle tour.
When a person tours it requires mental and physical strength. Most people are surprised to hear that mental strength is usually considered to be the most important quality.
(For those feeling a bit misled by the headline of this page please consider that the brain is indeed a muscle too. When bicycle touring I think it's the most important one even if it isn't the most obvious one during the first few days of a tour).
The pages that follow will discuss the physical and mental aspects of touring in greater detail.


#### Let's get physical! Preparing for the trials and tribulations that your physical body will experience
Physical strength is something that can usually be improved upon before the tour. Even if you don't there is a saying, "Train to tour or the tour trains you" that nicely summarizes the fact that if you don't train before the tour then you can certainly do the tour anyway.
Hopefully it's obvious that it's not a free ride. If you don't do any pretraining then you can expect to have harder then normal days for about the first week or two. After that your body will have taken up the challenge and responded to the touring needs by producing more muscle.
There are ways to reduce the impact through. Plan for shorter days during the first two weeks gradually ramping up towards your daily average goal. Factor in a few extra rest days to give your body a chance to heal if needed.
Of course you could always do something radical and actually train in advance for the tour. This training would involve simple things like riding your bike more often (perhaps even daily commutting back and forth to work), doing some stretching on a regular basis and for those wanted to be really prepared some strength training (which btw is apparently something we should all be doing regularily anyway regardless of touring plans).
All of this is great advice but what does it mean in practical terms?
"The distance you ride in a week at home is usually a reasonable or attainable goal for Day One of your tour."
As a rule of thumb this has typically worked out well for me whenever I've used it myself or mentioned it to anyone new to touring. It is important to note that it is a general statement. If you are someone who goes two or three hundred kilometers in a week you might not want to set a 200 to 300 km goal for day one. On the other hand if you do around 100 kilometers a week then based on my personal experience that is a very achievable distance.
I typically recommend a rest day every fourth or fifth day for the first week or two of your tour although personally I take rest days based upon inclination when I am on the road.
The next few pages will discuss some more suggestions on how to prepare for your tour in advance.

#### Preparing for your tour by bicycle commuting
Dale Owsald has been stepped up and volunteered to lead off on a page about getting started bicycle commuting.

For me bicycle commuting is the number one way that I prepare for my tours. Although I also use other methods the vast bulk of my preparation occurs everyday as I bicycle to work and back.

Without further ado I turn it over to Dale.....

> "Cycling to work (or shopping or visiting…) shouldn’t be a big deal. Most people who are of basically sound health and who live within ten miles of where they want to be can successfully use a bicycle to get there. Take a few simple preparatory steps and buy a couple of inexpensive things on the way home tonight and start riding tomorrow!

What you need to have:

- A bicycle suitable for your route.

Most bicycles will work for most routes. It need not be fancy, new or stylish. What it should be is reliable, so if you’re dragging the old beast out of the garage you may want to have a shop check it over.

- A helmet.

Any ANSI or Snell approved helmet. The $14.95 one from K Mart is just fine if it has one of these approvals.

- A Bag to carry stuff.

You don’t need anything fancy or expensive. Backpacks aren’t ideal but they will do the job. Try riding to work, and if you like it, go buy a proper pannier or seat bag.

- Contingency clothing. 

Toss an old jacket or raincoat in the bag.

- Some tools.

Buy a set of tire levers, a pump and a spare tube. Learn how to use them; a knowledgeable friend is the best teacher but a repair or owners manual will usually do. Practice at home or on an old bike. Put these things in your bag, or mount the pump on your bike if you have the brackets.

- Lock. If needed.

Some places let you park your bike inside or have a bike rack under the guard’s nose (and many perfectly useable commuter bikes have no theft value…).
"Effective Cycling" by John Forrester (ISBN: 0262560704):

Buy this book. Read the chapter on why you ought to obey the rules of the road, and the two simple rules on your lane positioning. Cycling is not an inherently dangerous activity if you use a little common sense and learn a couple of things.

**Planning:**

- Pick a route

Pick a route that has low traffic volumes or wide shoulders. Avoid expressway ramps; that is, places where the traffic merges onto or diverges off your route.

- Find out where you’re going to park your bike at work.

Decide whether you need to shower on arrival. This depends on how you are expected to look, distance ridden, your comfort level with being a little sticky and the weather. You can take a couple of these things to work and leave them there: Shower stuff if desired and your lock if needed.

- Take a trial run on the weekend to check out your route and determine how long you need to allow for travel.

On the day that you ride:

- Pack your bag with the stuff listed above, your change of clothes and a jacket or raincoat.
- Take some water if it’s hot and you’re riding more than a couple of miles
- Allow enough time to go at an easy pace.
- Start out easy, relax, pay attention and have a good time.

Dale mentions a number of excellent points but I would like to add a few more.
Bicycling to work can be alot of fun and often gives you a very nice break between the stresses of work and the pleasures of home. While cycling you have the chance to think about your day, see the scenery and contemplate life. I find that my cycle commute often one of the best parts of my day.
Many people think of commutting as something that can only be accomplished during the spring, summer and fall seasons. This isn't necessarily true. You always have to look at your comfort level but it is very possible and enjoyable to ride through the winter months too. If you are interested in learning more about Icebiking consider looking at the Icebike website and joining the associated Mailing List.
When considering your route always be on the lookout for alternatives. I actually have three different main routes that I take in to work.
The first route is about 10 km long and consists of a series of small roads and multi-use paths. The multi-use path is especially nice since it runs alongside a river, meanders through some woods, has very low traffic in the morning and allows me to skip railroad tracks, traffic lights and stop signs. It even has a hill or two to make it extra enjoyable.
The second route is a longer route that mostly runs right next to the river on technical single track. Although I have ridden this with a touring bike it is most enjoyed riding a mountain bike.
My final route is a short, direct line, route that gets me to work in the shortest distance along mainly low traffic streets. There are lots of stop signs and a couple of traffic lights but when I am in a hurry or I just want to go on a short ride then this is the one I take. I use this route more in the winter then any other time.
Another excellent book that covers "cycling in traffic": strategies is "the Art of Urban Cycling - Lessons from the Street" by Robert Hurst (ISBN: 0-7627-2783-7).
I am lucky enough to work for a company that provides secure indoor lockups for bicyclists. You might consider asking your employer if they have a basement storeroom or something similar that you can also use.
The type of bike you ride may also play a role when commuting. In order to reach my lockup facility I need to descend in an elevator. This works fine for both my touring and winter bikes but it could be trickier for a long wheelbase recumbent.
When it comes right down to it the most important thing needed to start bicycle commuting is a decision on your part to give it a real try for some period of time. Usually a week or two is enough to give you an understanding of how well it works for you!
What is easy to confirm though is that by riding into work on a daily basis you are making your first few days of touring significantly easier!


### Mental Strength: You can or you can't. Whichever you choose you are right!

During the hardest and most brutal day of my Round Lake Huron tour I heard that quote come in over the radio. This was Day Four of the tour, my fourth consecutive day of headwinds and I was also battling incredibly HOT temperatures throughout the day.

Apparently it's something Henry Ford said at one time. Personally I am thankful to him for saying it because after mulling it over in my mind for a while I reached deep down inside and summoned the physical strength needed to complete my planned distance for the day. At the end of that day I felt on top of the world and ready to go another 100 km such is the power of the mind! (grin)

I mentioned earlier that I think mental strength is the most important personal strength that you will need in touring. For most people this is a bit of a shock. How could a bicycle tour require more mental then physical strength?

Well occasionally you will find yourself mentally tired even if your body is physically fine. An example of this could be after riding against a headwind every day for a week or feeling worn down from the constant roller coaster ride up and down mile after mile of hilly terrain or maybe you just find yourself missing your friends and family or even wondering what you are doing out here in the middle of nowhere all by yourself!

All of these examples point to the need for mental strength. I have found that the body will typically go where the mind directs it to. Unfortunately if the mind goes then the body tends to collapse and wait for instructions.

Sometimes the cause of the mental collapse can be traced to a lack of food, water or the need for a rest day. Other times the secret lies in searching for and finding the good element of a day regardless of the problems that were encountered during that day.

I firmly believe that the most important thing you can bring to a tour is a positive mental attitude!

Sometimes a route can be mentally overwhelming. The danger here is that people get caught up with thinking about how long it will take to complete some huge distance rather then instead visualizing the distance broken down into reasonable chunks. When you think about going around Lake Huron the distance seems much, much longer and more difficult then if you just think about needing to complete the distance around the Thumb of Michigan before thinking about the next chunk of the trip. So the trick here is to break the trip down into manageable chunks and get as much enjoyment out of each section as possible!

> "Of all the days I've toured, the closest I ever came to bailing out was a windy, rainy, hilly day in Cape Breton. There were several strikes against me - I had gone into the ditch two days previously an dmy legs weer a bit beat up, the weather had taken a decided turn for the worst, and I knew that if I really needed to, my mother-in-law would come pick me up. (Her summer house was the base-station for my ride.) She'd been quite concerned with me bike up and down the hills of the Cabot Trail, and had made the offer before I left. I guess it stuck in my mind.
Two mountains, five hours, and a horrid 40 km into headwinds later, I was ready to quit. I phoned 'home', and found out that my mother-in-law and the gang had actually driven the entire Cabot Trail the day before, looking for me, but had missed me.
Somehow, that steeled my resolve a bit, so I got back on my squishy bike and kept riding. I was on flatter terrain by then, the wind started to die down, and eventually the sun came out. Six hours later, I was having a very entertaining evening with a nice American couple I met in the campground, shooting the breeze and drinking their wine. It turned into one of the nicest days I'd ever spent on a bike, in fact.
To this day, I still think of that as two separate days, even though they both occured on the same leaf of the calendar."

#### Tips and Tricks to help you get through a hard day!
There are probably a few people who just read these two comments from two different writers and all of a sudden their desire to tour plummetted. I feel the need to point out that I am talking about my worst touring experience on the same day as my best. Most touring days will be somewhere in between.

For the hard days there are tricks that can be used to help you through them. Here are a few:

1) When fighting headwinds all day I find some nice music to be very helpful. I currently use a mp3 player for this but in the past I used a FM radio. Typically one earphone in the right ear and no earphone in the left. This may not work for everyone and apparently it might even be illegal in some parts of the world

2) Breaking the day into chunks. Brian Huntley posted the following, "If I make it to that rocky outcrop, I'll coast for a few seconds"?
I also use this technique to get through the distance.

3) Moni Neville provides this quote:
"Don't worry, I have time. If I didn't I wouldn't be on a bicycle."
Moni mentioned that "usually this was my answer to people excusing themselves because they were making me wait for 'whatever'."
Her comment also works well for those days when the elements seem to be conspiring against you. When it comes down to it what exactly is the rush? Take some time to smell the roses as the old saying goes.
When I am in the rose mindset I find that I can just sit back and go at whatever the happy pace is and eventually arrive somewhere.
I know that there are other techniques to add to this page. I plan to include comments on group touring and mascots elsewhere but if you have some additional tips please put them in the guestbook or drop me an email so that I can include them.
In the next few pages I will mention a few topics that tend to be related to or assist with the mental aspects of touring. Examples include touring solo or in a group, riding with a mascot, bringing your family along on the ride and bringing along your pets.

#### Solo versus Group Touring
One of the most common questions that seemed to be asked during my Round Lake Erie and Round Lake Huron tours was if I was travelling all alone.

Most of the time it was asked with a tone of concern or puzzlement accompanied with constant glancing in the direction from which I came.

At first I responded by saying that it was only me. Later when the funny side of my personality came to the forefront I would reply with, "No there are three of us, Me, Myself and I". The look of relief, followed by puzzlement and then laughter always led to a great conversation since the ice was now broken.

Still the question is valid and usually comes down to one of the following variations:

Aren't you lonely all by yourself?
Don't you get scared. Is it safe?
So let's started by answering the questions about solo touring.

Solo Riding:

For me solo touring is seldom lonely since you have lots of opportunities to meet people. People will often approach you and talk to you when they see a solo rider while staying away if they see a group of riders approach.

This is even more common in a public campground. A good example was my visit to Tawas State Park in Michigan. I was invited to watch the sunset by one couple, three couples invited me to sit by their campfires to share stories and the next morning I received two separate breakfast invitations all without any asking or hinting on my part. Something about solo touring seems to bring out the gentler side of people when they meet you.

Another way to meet some incredible people is to watch for other riders on bikes out for a day ride. During my Round Lake Huron trip especially I spent an enjoyable couple of hours on several different days riding with people out for day rides. It gave me an excellant opportunity to see the local community while having an excellent conversation with someone from that community.

An extension of this is that I managed to ride with several Cross Canada riders during the same tour. There is something really motivating and awe inspiring about riding with people who are riding your dream tour.

When you tour by yourself you have the advantage of being able to have a rest day whenever you want. You can also stop for museums, art, local festivals, motels, campgrounds etc. Should you decide to go for a big distance day then that too is possible. All without needing to consult with anyone else.

Still solo touring has some potential issues. There is a bit more of a mental toll since all decisions need to be made by you. Physically you need to carry your own load and have the discipline and committment to meet your goals.

"When the times get tough, the tough keep going" is something you might want to remember on the odd, less then perfect, day.

Safety is one of those issues where it appears at first glance that you would be safer in a group. When riding alone you know how you will react in a bad situation and you have no one to worry about but yourself. This gives you a lot of flexibility.

Some studies about bear attacks appear to have shown that all recorded bear attacks have happened with group sizes of less then six people and single person groups have been the majority of cases. Still only approximately 36 people have died from bear attacks in the last forty years so I don't see this as an overwhelming safety issue. It's likely one that can be covered off by practicing proper bear safety techniques. This will be discussed in a later section of this article.

Group Riding:

Group riding is something I have also done. When you go on a group ride you have to consider group dynamics. These dynamics can often affect your own personal freedom depending on how you handle the issues that come up. As an example you might have to consider some simple issues like:

How do you handle wanting to start at 05:00 am and your buddy wanting to hit the road at noon?

Perhaps you want to end for the day at 16:00 while your friends would rather ride into the night.

Stop to eat lunch at a restaurant or cook something? 
Camp or motel today?
Visit a museum or go for a long distance ride?

So many questions to consider!

There are lots of good sides through too. You get to ride with a friend and share conversations. Depending on your plans you may be able to share some items like stoves and tents reducing the amount of weight that you each have to carry individually.

When something breaks you have at the very least a useful sounding board as you try to work through the problem and at the best an absolute mechanical genius who can fix anything.

Headwind days can be mellowed by taking terms breaking wind. (Of course if you have chili for lunch or dinner then you can break wind then too in a very different way! (grin)).

Run out of water or snacks and need some? Perhaps your friends have some to share.

Of course if you are unlucky enough to have a dog chasing you instead of being faster then the dog you just have to be faster then your friends! (very big grin)

I've toured both ways and I like both for different reasons.

Here are some other viewpoints

"Things are much easier, and safer feeling with partners. I was very honored that Stephen and Gary both decided to join me on this trip. They were great companions at every point along the way!"

Robert Stowe

"The reality is that women face far, far more risks when touring alone than do men. Many groups I have encountered have more women than men - while almost every solo tourer has been male. I met a young Japanese women in Cincinnati in 1987 and a med student from Chicago up in Alaska in 2002, but the ratio is about 99 to 1."

John Egan


#### Touring as one big happy family, Feldmann style!
I have never toured as part of a family group so naturally I looked elsewhere to see how others have managed. One of the most enjoyable family oriented journals I've read on crazyguyonabike is by the Feldmann family.

Later this year they plan to cross the second largest country in the world by bicycle as a family unit. The country is Canada and the remainder of this page let's them discuss touring in their own words.

How do you feel about touring by bicycle?

"I like bicycle touring because you have more time to look around at the scenery. You have more time to get somewhere and not have a time limit to get there.

You always have a reward after climbing a hill, and the reward is the down hill.

When you tour through new towns, you get to check out all the different bathrooms.

That is some of the reasons why I like bicycle touring."

Tristan Feldmann, age 9

"I like bicycle touring for many reasons.

My family rides self-supported and carries everything ourselves.

Bicycle touring is an awesome way to travel a country or a region.

What I like about bicycle touring is the freedom and scenery.

I also like meeting new people and visiting places that I knew zilch about before.

After a good days ride, it is always nice to look forward to a cold pop or ice cream cone.

Rainy weather can be a pain, but it won’t dampen this CRAZY family’s spirits!!"

Stefan Feldmann, age 12

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20111025115635if_/http://bicycletouring101.com/getimage.php?w=800&o=no&i=FeldmannFamilyGroupShot.jpg)


"I like to discover what is around the corner and to see new things, new vistas. Yes, dealing with the unexpected can be trying sometimes, but sometimes it opens new doors. The slow pace of time is very appealing when we’re touring. The soul always feels better when it’s relaxed.

I enjoy tasting new foods from new places. As the family chef, preparing quick cooking healthy camp meals requires extra effort, so it’s always a treat to splurge in restaurants.

Touring will give you a sense of freedom, which you could only match if traveling on foot. The ultimate touring trip would find me in exotic places (South America, Tajikistan, Georgia in former Russian Republic, Nepal, parts of China). I prefer traveling away from the masses.

Touring is fun. Since we are rarely in a rush, we often stop for short breaks and inevitably someone in the family gets goofy.

Feeling the sweat run down your face and back actually feels good.

It’s good to listen to the sounds of the environment around you (minus the cars). Your sense of smell comes alive too, especially when you smell a grizzly bear!

Traveling with children encourages you to see things through their eyes, their interpretation. You get a better understanding of life’s priorities if you see it from a child’s perspective."

Fritz Feldmann, age 48


"I like the sense of independence that touring provides. All that I need, I have with me. My husband, my children, our basic items to survive. Having less, is more.

Touring provides the freedom to go at my own speed, not to be within a pack of cars going 110 km/hr. I also like reaching a summit using my own muscles. You appreciate the scenery a lot more!

I like the freedom to eat ice cream without any guilt. Speaking of eating, food tastes way better when you are hungry after a long day of riding. It’s also fun trying out the occasional new restaurant along the route.

Touring means new adventures, new discoveries, new places, and meeting new people from all walks of life. Touring makes us more open minded and open hearted.

Personally, when we travel as a family, I feel a deep sense of togetherness. I am focused on our time together. Touring creates life long bonding."

Cynthia Feldmann, age 46

What things do you think are most important to your family's successful touring experiences?

"Money for ice cream, an occasional playground, and not having to do too many chores when we arrive at camp."

Tristan

"Drink lots, eat often and keep a steady pace."

Stefan

"For me, taking along a tiny but proper pillow ensures I have a good sleep. A good sleep guarantees me a good next day. Also, a comfortable seat is a must item for me. Thanks to doing the “butt test” I have finally found a seat that fits me, and I don’t mind spending 8 hours in the saddle."

Cynthia

"Having well behaved children helps a lot! Personally, as long as I remember to eat before I get hungry, and drink often, then the day is much more enjoyable no matter what events occur."

Fritz

What one thing do you worry about the most when considering your upcoming Cross Canada touring adventure?

"I’m not a worry-wart. I just want to get going and leave soon!"

Tristan

"I’m not worried about anything, yet…maybe I’ll get the jitters a few days before we leave. Maybe not."

Stefan

"I worry about my parent’s worrying about us."

Cynthia

"Due to my food allergies, intolerances and dietary restrictions, I’m a bit worried about the availability of food along some remote sections. I’ll just have to make a concerted effort to always stock up on fresh fruit and veggies, and have a stash of good food tucked away in case we are in between food sources."

Fritz

Any helpful advice for other parents who are thinking about taking their kids on a tour?

"Train lots for biking so you’re really comfortable riding. Practice riding on your street, then city streets, then the highway. Use hand signals only before the turn, not during the turn. Wear bright clothing. And a helmet. No standing up to pedal when you are on the highway. Don’t let mom catch you looking around too much."

Tristan

"Ride safely and enjoy the downhills."

Stefan

"Be patient. Be enthusiastic. Be supportive. Be receptive to the children’s slow speed sometimes. Remember to stop lots and have snacks handy. Give children the opportunity to excel and they will rise to the occasion."

Cynthia

"Teach safe riding habits. Set good examples. Talk as a family about how to improve safety habits (don’t ride too close behind each other; signal well ahead of the turns, no looking around turning your heads, no weaving around and being goofy). Take the children to a playground and let them burn off energy.

I also think it’s really important that you arrive in camp before dinner time. This way the children have time for chores (filling water bottles and camels, setting up the tent, airing out the sleeping bags, filling the Therma-Rests) and time to play a bit. Meanwhile dad prepares dinner while mum does her daily maintenance on all the bikes (yes, in our family roles are definitely switched around!). This routine ensures an early bed time for everyone, ready for an early start to another day of adventure.

Don’t have too grandiose of plans when you are starting out on a tour. Start with a one night trip, but stay away from traveling on long weekends – traffic volumes increase tenfold.

Be attuned to your child’s body language, moods, and be very willing to stop lots."

Fritz

What will you miss while you are away touring?

"Getting up at 5:00 a.m. to do newspaper routes. I’ll really miss that! :)"

Tristan

"Lego and listening to music and the news and reading Clive Cussler books."

Stefan

"I'll miss my hair dryer, but I guess after 46 years, it's about time I got used to my naturally curly frizzy hair! I’m taking a summer skirt and nice top with me, but I’m sure that after 5 months of living in the same cycling outfits I’ll be craving for some different clothes!"

Cynthia

"I’ll miss my Paderno cooking pots. Otherwise, I really don’t think I’ll miss anything."

Fritz

What do you think will be the most exciting aspect of your tour?

"Checking out all the restaurants and ice cream stands – yummy yes."

Tristan

"Checking out the new house we’ll eventually live in, somewhere, but we don’t know where. That’s exciting."

Stefan

"I’m looking forward to compiling a list of all the many different places we’ll sleep over the 5 months. While some people may worry about that, I’m intrigued about all the possibilities (behind churches, inside firehalls, in farmer’s fields, in gravel pits, in abandoned buildings). It would be great to also stay with other Canadian families - even on their soft lawns would be a treat. "

Cynthia

"Every day will be exciting for me, I hope. I love traveling, and experiencing new places. I’ve always had the travel bug in me since my childhood in Switzerland, and my youth spent traveling in Sweden and England. I’m also looking forward to scouting various attributes of the campgrounds we’ll stay at. One day our family hopes to operate a campground so I’ll be making notes from a cyclist’s point of view."

Fritz

Do you have any suggestions for other kids whose parents want to take them along on a bicycle tour?

"Remind your parents that it’s not a race and we’re here to enjoy ourselves Let us stop and play somewhere. We’ve been known to play in a ditch while our parents chatted with some people along the road. Give us dirt and grass and we’re happy.

Don’t bribe children to ride. That defeats the whole purpose of the ride."

Stefan and Tristan

#### Touring as one big happy family - Gagnon style!
Michel Gagnon is a well respected member of many of the Mailing Lists and cycling related forums that I participate in. He has made very knowledgable replies to queries for everything from Icebiking to bicycle advocacy and of course bicycle touring. Michel brings his highly developed common sense to all of the information that he shares.

Back in the 1980's Michel toured various parts of Eastern Canada. Today he has continued that activity by bringing his two beautiful daughters along with him when he tours.

Touring with the Gagnon family

I have enjoyed cycling and touring for as long as I remember. Wouldn't it be a good idea to introduce our children to cycling and touring too? Why not take advantage of tools that were not available when I was young?

My children started bicycle touring gradually at a young age. Just like we adults need some training before we undertake a major tour, children also need some training too! They have to build up their endurance and their stamina. Adults need to adapt their touring style accordingly.

Training

Both children were indroduced to the trailercycle at 4.The first rides with Ève were a few kilometres long and without steep hills. Within a few outings, Ève was enjoying 50-75 km day rides on the trailercycle. I then gradually added more serious hills as climbs were essential to my training and downgrades were essential to hers. She was afraid of grades any steeper than two or three percent.

Another aspect of training is being able to ride some distance without complaining and hopefully while enjoying it. We live in a city and our normal rides are in or around the city so my children had to learn about riding longer distances in rural settings. On the other hand they had no problems with cars passing close to us.

The first tours : a slow introduction to touring

I did my first tour when Ève was 5. It was a 6-day tour. Two days riding from Montréal to Trois-Rivières via Joliette, followed by two days spent at grandma's home and then two days riding back via the direct road. It meant two nights camping but it also allowed me to time the trip with decent weather. I didn't want her first experience to be a miserable one. We did a similar trip the year after using different routes. In 2003 we did a 11-day tour from Montréal to Québec city going one way along the northern fringe of the St. Lawrence valley and coming back on the South Shore via Victoriaville.

The trip was loaded with new experiences:

Three days with four other people, including a child her age
One visit of a farm -- totally unplanned -- with a tractor ride and a tour of the stable
Most nights camping combined with one night in a Bed & Breakfast and one night in a motel. We camped eight out of eleven nights
Two and a half rest days camping at places with nice beaches, friends and playground activities
Many roads, a few killer hills (yes, we walked some), a couple of days on rural bike paths and some great cheese
some great weather, but also a few days with drizzle or light rain and one day with a real downpour
Touring with children is not economical, especially when one considers the ice-cream budget but it is wonderful to see them in direct contact with nature. When we did a multi-day trip by car in the summer of 2004, I was struck by the fact Ève is much more aware of her surroundings when we travel by bike than when we travel using a car. I look forward, albeit with some apprehension, to the 2005 tour with my two daughters who will then be 9 and 5.

 
 
#### Family on a Bike and The Family Adventure Project

The Feldmann and Gagnon families are two families that bicycle tour. They've been featured in other pages on this site.

From Guestbook entries, survey responses and private email messages it is obvious to me that there is a lot of interest in bicycle touring as a family. One web site that attempts to fill this niche is Family On A Bike. This web site features a number of resources that families interested in touring together might like to consider.

Here's a little more information about Family On A Bike submitted by Stuart Wickes from Family On A Bike.

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20150208122017/http://www.familyonabike.org/)
Family On A Bike is a family run project and web site which aims to inspire other families to live adventurously by showcasing inspiring stories and journals of family adventurers around the world.

Stuart Wickes and Kirstie Pelling, the Mum and Dad of familyonabike, are both keen cycle tourists who have toured extensively in the UK, Europe and South America. Now with a growing family, their touring continues but with the added excitement and challenge of taking the toddlers. They see no reason why children should be an obstacle to adventurous long distance touring or adventuring in other ways.

Stuart and Kirstie hope that by sharing their own stories and those of the other adventurous families they have tracked down and interviewed for the project, they can help others learn about the many different ways, trials, tribulations, dramas and delights of adventuring as a family, and develop the inspiration and commitment to give it a go themselves.

#### Taking your pet(s) along for the ride
If you look at the following link you will find stories about people who have taken their pets along on tour with them:

![](http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/journal/?category_id=275)

Unfortunately I don't have a pet right now and I have never taken a pet along with me on tour so I can't provide personal comments on this topic.

It's my hope that people will drop me an email with their quotes and/or pictures of tours that they have completed with their pets along so that I can create an informative web page on this topic.

I would be especially interested in knowing what worked out well, what didn't and what you would do differently when the pet tours again (or will there be a next time?)!


##### Crossing the southern US with two Jack Russells and a lot of motivation.
Today it was my pleasure to interview Team Russell regarding their recent very successful journey across the Southern United States by bicycle.

Team Russell consists of two Jack Russell Terriers and Hank Raines. Hank is the group leader, bicycle engine and spokesman for this group.

On to the interview.....

What motivated you to bring two Jack Russell's along on your Coast to Coast tour across the southern portion of the United States?

"I adopted Airwick and Agape in March of 2004. It was obvious when I'd get the bicycle out that Airwick wanted to tag along so we began with a leash system where he would run along side. I'd leave him at home for the longer rides and he was very unhappy so we began experimenting. Ordered the Xtracycle for my own cross country and realized that it could be adapted to make room for the pets. 1,000 practice miles and then a trip down the Atlantic Coast and I knew we were ready."

What preparations did you make to help your dogs to have a comfortable adventure with you?

"We customized our own seat to fit them perfectly. Then lots of practice adding or taking away things that were/weren't needed. It was a fun spring."

What additional changes would you make prior to your next tour with your dogs? - Will there be a next tour?

"Depending on when we tour, I'd add some type of small heater to their seat for the cold mornings. If this turns out to not be practical, which is certainly might, I think having two jerseys made out of the same wool as our jerseys would be a good addition. "

If you had to name the one moment that you think your dogs enjoyed the most what would it be?

"There were several. We all three loved our little breaks throughout the day just to relax and sit with each other. Airwick loved all the animals that we'd pass and Agape loved all the attention from the people we met."

What was your favourite moment of the trip?

"Hurricane in Savannah and almost every night snuggled in the tent with my two babies."

How did the tour change you as a person? Did it motivate you to make any changes upon your return home?

"It has changed our lives in that cycling is a permanent part of our daily rituals now. We will also be going on at least one extended tour a year when time and responsibilities allow."

Any advice for others who are considering touring with their pets?

"You know your pet best. The premise that some people will try a long tour or cross country with a pet that isn't ready is possible but highly unlikely. If you tour with your pet for the wrong reasons, you're going to fail. Start off very slow and be prepared to adapt, adjust to things as they come along. be prepared to watch and listen to their needs on the road. Their needs change when out on the road just like your own. best reminder is that your pet will experience your trip much as you do."

Is there any thing else that you would like to discuss?

Update, December 28,2004

Hi Jamie, here's our "what's next" I promised you. Our new goal is to bicycle as much of the Pan American Highway as possible. From Argentina to Alaska would be our dream but we are running into obstacles with allowing my terriers to safely cross the different borders. I've never successfully toured without my faithfull companion Sir Airwick and frankly don't think I can succeed without him. I've contemplated leaving them both home and adopting one of the many strays supposedly throughout S America but it wouldn't be the same. The dogs are my security, my companions, and my best friends. Unfortunately I'm running out of time unless we switch directions and start in Alaska in early summer. Anyone who can point me in the direction of people and organizations who can help us safely complete this trip will be honorary members of Team Russell. I am confident we could complete the 16,000 mile trip in approximately six months. Without Airwick, I'd probably not get out of Buenos Aries.

#### Keeping a Journal

##### Why keep a journal?

When I go on a tour I now keep a journal of my adventure but this wasn't always the case. I started keeping a journal after my first tour when I realized that people were genuinely interested in my travels and as time passed the details were beginning to get fuzzy in my mind.

The solution for me was to start keeping a journal. There are many different ways to keep a journal and I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each type on the remainder of this page.

Before I get started I should mention a secondary reason for keeping a journal. It's been mentioned on previous pages that a tour can occassionally be mentally taxing. On those rare days it is nice to be able to go back and read through your old journal entries or view the pictures you took on past days. Both add to the sense of accomplishment and remembered pleasure of a tour.

##### Traditional methods

Historiically and currently many people keep a journal using an old fashioned pen and paper. This method has several advantages including being cost-effective (read cheap) and very versatile since it's easy to have the stuff within easy reach at all times no matter where you are.

I kept a journal this way during my Round Lake Erie tour and it worked.

There were a couple of disadvantages for me.

Without careful protection of the notepad it was possible for a rain storm to make the journal a soggy mess.

I also found that when writing up my journal entries I would typically put things in point form leaving the proper forming of sentences until later. Of course the later is also part of the problem since I produced a web journal from the written journal later on meaning that I made the effort twice (not that this in itself is bad since it gave me a chance to relive the tour again).

Even with the other methods that I will discuss in the next few sections taking along a notepad and a pen are still a good idea. There will be times on the road when you just want to jot down a quick note or someone's email address and for this pen and paper are usually the fastest and easiest way to do this.

##### Internet based journals

Another way to keep a journal is to set up a website on the internet and upload your journal entries to it.

If you are not comfortable with creating a website or using a web page editor fear not! There are some excellent web sites that have already gone a long way towards doing most of the work for you.

An example of these sites is ![](www.crazyguyonabike.com). This is a web site that features a constantly growing collection of tour reports from people all over the world. This is a non-commerical site that was originally created by Neil Gunton to help him to record his 1998 tour across the United States. Since then he has worked hard to create tools that make it much easier for other people to create their web journals easily and without cost (since he has offered the use of his website free to the public at considerable cost to himself).

Creating a journal on this site is very easy. Register as a new user and select the option to create a new journal. Creating pages comes down to clicking a button. Add your text to text boxes and import your pictures using very easy to use controls.

When you are all done you click another button to publish your work of art to share it with others. Included with your journal is a guestbook giving other people the option to ask questions, provide words of encouragement and of course thank you for sharing your journal with them.

You can of course create your online journal following your tour. This is how I setup my Round Lake Erie tour on crazyguyonabike.

Another option is to setup your web site before your tour with basic things like your introduction and other pre-tour type pages. Once you are on tour you can add new pages while on the road by stopping in at internet cafe's and public libraries. This gives you the ability to add an interactive flavour to your journal and let's people really follow along with you on your travels.

I did this for my Round Lake Huron tour and I found that it really added to the adventure. However I didn't use public libraries or internet cafe's to update my journal. Instead I used something called a pocketmail device to send emails to the website. These emails were interpreted and converted to new web pages detailing my journal entries. I will mention the pocketmail device in later section on this page.

Some people would rather create their own website and pages manually instead. There are numerous websites out there that have this kind of setup. The disadvantage is that you have to do all the work yourself usually using an html editor and some photo editing software at the very least.

What you gain is complete freedom to setup your website the way you like it rather then in accordance with a template or rules.

A variation of this approach is to bring a notebook along on tour, create your webpages and upload them periodically.

#### Tips for creating an interesting bicycle touring journal
Some people write a journal strictly for their own personal use. Often they want to have a way to help them remember the tour in great detail at a later date. Perhaps they will record their distance, the people they met and other pieces of information that are important to them.

Other bicycle tourists enjoy keeping the information for themselves but also sharing their touring adventure with as many people as care to read about it. There are several web sites on the web with ![](Crazyguyonabike.com) being perhaps the one most often mentioned when it comes to bicycle touring journals.

I confess that I am in the second group of journal writers. I derive a great deal of pleasure sharing my touring experiences with others including my friends, co-workers and anyone else who manages to stumble upon my journals. A secondary effect of writing a journal is that I usually do so at the end of each touring day so I have the opportunity to think about the major events of the day just before I go to sleep. This leaves my mind fresh and my body ready to take on the coming day.

Originally I had intended to write an article containing some suggestions for creating a bicycle touring related journal that people enjoy reading. Since I still have some work to do to master the craft I was overjoyed to discover that Carsten Hoefer had already taken on this important subject.

As a fan of a journal he wrote called "Visiting Dracula" I was quite happy to read what he had to say especially when I discovered that he used numerous examples from other ![](crazyguyonabike.com) journals to illustrate his points. I am going to list the high points in this article but I encourage you to visit the original and read his suggestions in greater detail.

Carsten made the following suggestions for improving a bicycle touring journal:

Put yourself in the readers seat

When writing your journal think about the people who will be reading it and try to give them the background information that will make it both enjoyable and useful to them.

Consider what you want to write about

It's your journal after all so write about the things that matter to you. If you don't care about the distance you've travelled then don't focus on that. Instead focus on the things that mattered to you during the course of your adventure.

Some suggestions about what you could write about in your journal

Carsten mentions scenery, people and food as three areas that you might want to consider discussing in your journal. He points out that all three are typically of interest to people and quite possibly might be an important part of your bicycle touring experience.

The difficult beginning

The beginning of any journal can be quite difficult to get started so once again he's provided some interesting examples from journals actually on ![](Crazyguyonabike.com).

Spelling and Grammar

Since spelling and grammar are the structure of communication in any language it's no surprise that he mentions their importance.

Crasten's article appears to be a living document so over time I believe that it is likely to continue to grow with even more helpful suggestions. One additional suggestion was mentioned in the article's guestbook and that was to simply read lots of books. After reading a number of books your understanding of grammar, spelling and different ways to phrase things would likely be useful to you when writing as well. This suggestion is another excellent one that I also agree with completely.



#### Taking pictures
I had absolutely no intention of taking a camera with me on my Round Lake Erie tour. Fortunately a co-worker and friend strongly advised me to take one anyway. He said that I could always take a simple disposable with me. It would be minimal weight and I was unlikely to be worried about theft or damage.

I took his advice and headed out with a simple disposable camera that could capture 36 pictures.

By the time that tour was over I was carrying three mismatched disposable cameras holding a total of 58 pictures from my adventure.

Still I wasn't sure about a camera for a future trip.

What clinched this for me was when I realized how much fun it was to share the pictures with others and then later I began to notice how often I was looking at these pictures on a semi-regular basis.

One additional advantage of carrying a digital camera with you on your bicycle touring adventure is that you can review the pictures at any time including sharing them with some curious people along the way.

More information about choosing a touring camera, mounting a camera directly on your bike, taking better pictures, and editing your pictures after the tour can be found in the Planning/Photography section of this website.

#### Video taping your bicycle tour

One of the benefits of this web site is that people share their experiences with you. Of course I think the shared aspect of this site is also the key factor in what makes it of value to people. Rather then just hearing one person's opinion you get the opportunity to benefit from many!

Recently Jeff Palmer shared his bicycle touring experience with me using pictures. Unlike most journals where you see a mix of words and static images, Jeff chose to video tape his adventure and he sent me a copy of his DVD to watch.

Jeff rode the Great Divide Ride in the United States as part of a group of people. Two years later he returned once again to redo a few sections that were rained out the first tour. Watching his video was very interesting to me since I've often thought about doing this particular tour but I've never really appreciated what to expect despite reading numerous books before now.

With Jeff's video I was able to enjoy a view of the tour as seen through the lens of his video camera. Instead of wondering what the roads were like or what equipment was used I could easily see the answers to those questions as well as many more.

After watching the DVD I had several questions for Jeff. The following questions and answers will hopefully give you a bit more information about how you can video tape your own bicycle touring adventure as well as some information related to the Great Divide Ride.

What equipment did you need to take with you on tour to allow a video?

I used a mini-DV camera I purchased in 1999, a JVC DVM50. It weighs a little more than a pound. I had 2 spare batteries and the recharger with me. I had a mini tripod with me but never used it. I carried the camera in a small camera case which I carried in my waterproof handlebar bag.

During your video there are many moments when it appears that you are riding a bike and taping at the same time. How did you manage to do that? Was it tricky?

I carry the camera in my handlebar bag and when I see a shot I want I just take out the camera and video tape while I'm riding one handed. I've thought about a helmet cam, but I like the diversity of angles when I use the camera by hand. I ride a full-suspension Santa Cruz Superlight which does an amazing job of smoothing out the road. I didn't try to tape while riding when the terrain was rough, such as on some of the single track or mud. It's also difficult to film in bad weather so you get the impression from the video that the weather is always terrific.

I've been filming from my bike for several years but previous trips were on the road.

The hardest part about filming an area you haven't been in before is getting to the good spots before the riders, and they aren't willing to stop. I had to ride hard to get ahead so I can do the filming.

Your video of the Great Divide ride is incredible to watch! How much of your raw footage actually made it in to the end product?

The first video, I had about 3 hours of footage. I edited it down to two hours for all the participants on the trip, and then made the shorter version (about 50 minutes) for the general public. The first tour I signed up with Adventure Cycling.

Before watching your video I had a mild desire to ride the Great Divide Ride. Now that I've seen it the urge has become much more burning. Any tips for people thinking about setting out on their first Great Divide Ride (I believe you did it at least twice).

I've been touring for almost 45 years, road riding, with an upright and recumbents (since 1980). I had read about the Divide Ride but didn't consider it because I was in my 50's and had never ridden a mountain bike. In the summer of 2000, Sandy (my wife) and I were touring in Wyoming. While in the Tetons we met a Divide rider (Richard), who was on the Adventure Cycling tour. He was very enthusiastic about the trip.

We ran into Richard 10 days later in Rawlins, WY. Sandy and I drove to Denver and rode our bikes from Denver to Durango. On the way to Durango, we ran into Richard again in Salida and he highly recommended the trip. I took the fact that we ran into him 3 times was a message for me to ride the Divide.

In December, 2000, I purchased my Santa Cruz. I tried to find friends to go on the Divide Ride but no one wanted to commit that much time. I told Sandy I wouldn't attempt the trip alone because I was unfamiliar with mountain bike touring and worried about crashing in the middle of nowhere. Therefore I decide to signup with Adventure Cycling, my first group tour. Twelve riders, including 2 leaders, left the Canadian border June 15th. Nine of us used B.O.B.'s. Several people had a trailer as well as front panniers. Most of us used Hydration packs. Six of the riders planned on calling it quits while the rest of us were riding the entire trip. By the time we started the 2nd half of the trip, we were down to 4 riders, although we did meet other riders on the trip who rode with us for various amounts of time.

The riding was challenging, but not as difficult as I thought it would be. I was probably the best road rider in the group, but in the middle of the group as far as mountain biking. Probably the most difficult thing to do is figuring out how much food and water to carry with you. Our longest stretch without a water supply was 3 days.

I enjoyed the other participants. We had a great time camping, cooking, playing, etc. Since I was making the video, I made it a point to ride with all the riders. Most of the riders just rode with 1 or 2 other riders throughout the trip. Some riders started at 7:00, others 10:00.

The reason I rode a second time was to ride areas I had missed 2 years before because of the rain. New Mexico trails become impassable if they get lots of rain, which happened to me on both trips. There are still several parts of the dirt I've missed in New Mexico.

Tips
I think most of the suggestions by Adventure Cycling are quite good.

We ended up riding 50 days, but we had lots of rest days, almost 20. So we averaged about 50 miles per riding day. Shortest day was 25 miles, longest 95 miles. I think for experienced cyclist, 50 days total would be a comfortable time line.

I would try to ride the route a bit faster to avoid New Mexico in August. That is when the monsoon hits and the roads turn to mud. We did meet some riders going south to north who were doing well. I don't know if the ran into snow in Montana. If you ride north to south you really can't leave much before June 15th because of the snow, although changes in climate might change that. In 2001, our warmest riding was in Montana, about 95 degrees.

In my opinion, Montana is the best part of the trip. Lots of diversity, tough climbs, and single track. Colorado is the easiest riding. New Mexico is interesting but water problems, too much or too little, can frustrate you.

I really enjoyed this tour; it has spoiled me. It was so nice to ride and not have to worry about cars and trucks. There were days when didn't see a single vehicle! The experience was very similar to backpacking.

From your video it appears that roughly half the riders were using BOB trailers and the other half were using panniers. By the end of the ride was there a clear consensus on what worked better in particular conditions during the ride?

I don't think there was a clear consensus. The two fastest riders were using panniers, but I don't know if it was the panniers or their ability. The bikes with panniers had more problems with their wheels. We did have one trailer wheel's bearings freeze up and a couple of times the wheel came off. It makes for an interesting experience to watch your trailer wheel pass you!

I used a trailer for the first trip and full panniers on the second. I've used a B.O.B. on road trips as well with my Vision recumbent.

I had one bad experience with the trailer while riding in the Yukon (1998). I was descending a pass about 40 mph on pavement when the trailer started oscillating back and forth and crashed me. Needless to say that ended my trip with lots of road rash and messing up of my bike. Since then I don't go faster than 30 mph with the trailer. On the Divide tour I warned other riders about going fast but they ignored me. Some of them were descending at over 45 miles per hour on rough dirt roads. No one had any problems. I even started descending faster; up to 40 mph. I think the rough road prevent any problems with oscillation.

As far as my experience with panniers and a B.O.B. for touring on a full suspension bike, I had mixed experiences.

When pulling a trailer, I couldn't stand very well to climb because the action of the rear shock was greatly exaggerated with the trailer.

When I used panniers, the rear panniers affected the action of the rear shock as well. I think a better setup for touring would be a hardtail, but the full suspension sure helped me doing the video.

Life is a bunch of compromises. If I do another mountain bike trip, I'll probably use my trailer.

Do you offer your video for sale to others who might be interested in obtaining a copy from you?

I gave copies to all the participants. Several people bought copies. I just charge enough to cover cost to make the copy and shipping.

Can you say a bit more about the music. The kind and the style,,,what drew you to it?

Sandy and I spent the Fall of 2000 doing volunteer work at Bandelier National Monument. While we were there we had the opportunity to listen to several CD's written and performed by Native Americans. We really enjoyed the music and it seemed to match the mood of traveling by bike in the southwest. I got the music from 2 CD's, "Orenda" and "Weaving the Strands". Ironically, the songs on "Orenda" are written and performed by Joanne Shenandoah who is an Oneida Indian from a reservation in Central New York, about 30 miles from my home. I had to go to New Mexico to hear music from this area.

How did you go about creating the dvd? What software did you use? Do you have any tips for someone else considering doing something similar?

When I bought a camera, I specifically picked a DV camera so that I could save the video to digital tapes (MiniDV). I have a Macintosh G4 computer with 2 extra hard drives. I use Final Cut Pro software for editing the video. I transfer a tape directly to a hard drive and then edit the video. I then transfer the edited video back to a tape as a backup. From Final Cut Pro, I save the video in a format that can be transferred to a DVD. I use a software package, IDVD, to design my DVD and add the file from my video to IDVD. I have a built in DVD drive on my computer so I make the DVD from my computer.

What do you need to make a video?

A DV camera which usually starts at $400.00 USD. My camera would be about this price now although it was much more expensive 6 years ago. Obviously a small camera is much easier to carry on a trip; mine was 1 pound/2.2 kilograms. My camera has a 10:1 optical zoom which is plenty. I can't hold my camera steady at the longer zoom settings and I don't carry a tripod with me. I would love to find a camera that had simple features because I don't do any editing in the camera. Don't use a digital zoom while filming!

A Macintosh computer (minimum $800.00) with at least a G4 processor and Mac OS-X as the operating system. It is a good idea to have a second hard drive (minimum $100.00) to store your data. Video files are very large. A 1 hour video takes up about 25 GB of space. You can purchase a Mac with a SuperDrive which will allow you to create DVD's. A SuperDrive adds about $100.00 to the cost of the computer.

I used Final Cut Pro which I purchased before other software was available. New Macintosh computers now come with movie making software (iMovie) which will work just fine. Mac's also come with iDVD so you don't have to purchase any extra software.

The most important part of making a video is taking the raw video. It is difficult to make a good film with lousy footage. I highly recommend taking a beginning course in filmmaking. Most people don't know what to look for and how to shoot good video. I found a course very valuable. I always had my camera with me, on and off the bike, to be ready for good material. I have thought about mounting a camera to my helmet to shoot video, but decided that is too limiting, so when I shoot from the bike, I just hand hold the camera. That way I can get video in all directions. Just be careful to pay attention to the road as well as the subject.

The most time consuming part of making a video is the editing. It took many hours for me to edit the video from 3 hours down to less than 1 hour. Editing is critical for making a video that is interesting to the viewer. Again, a course in filmmaking really helps you learn how to do this.

It is very difficult to record sound of bike videos (especially while moving) unless you have very sophisticated equipment (expensive). I chose to just add music to the video. Some day I may write a narrative and add that to the video but I haven't been motivated to do that yet.

Question and answer session with Jeff Palmer

## Planning your very first bicycle touring adventure!

At this point you've read through a number of pages that explained what touring is and some information related to getting started touring. As you've turned each page your excitement has grown as you've realized that bicycle touring really is something that sounds like it's made to order for you.

After all what's not to like about seeing beautiful scenery, visiting new places and meeting interesting people?

Only one little problem remains, planning that first tour!
### Taking a fully supported/SAG tour first

When planning your first tour one easy option is to find a local company that offers fully supported tours. This option would supply you with full support during your first tour while providing you with an opportunity to see how well bicycle touring works for you. These tours will often include other riders as well so you will definately get a chance to meet others. Other advantages include not having to carry your gear, some meals are prepared for you and accomodations are setup in advance. Depending on the length of trip it might be cost effective to try touring this way first rather then splurge on bicycle equipment to allow you to carry your gear.

### Planning your own self-supported tour

On tour I will often receive questions from others about how to plan their first tour. My answer is usually to pick a motel, hotel or bed and breakfast within a comfortable bicycle ride from home. The distance should be slightly further then you've gone before if you are new to long distance cycling. Most new touring cyclists seem to find 20 t0 25 km a longish distance so I usually suggest finding a place about 30 km from home.

Ride from home to the accomodation carrying mimimal gear. Park the bike when you arrive and go out for a nice dinner, play, movie or visit something like a museum. Enjoy a comfortable sleep. The next day ride back home.

Just like that you've experienced your first tour. You were close enough to home to feel like you have bail-out options while being far enough away to experience an adventure. Costs are minimal since limited gear was carried (really just a change of clothing) and you managed to pack the bicycle touring experience into a small package during your tour. How? Well you experienced the bicycling, the good food, the comfortable sleep and the cultural experience all in one trip. It's very likely that you spoke with at least one other person about cycling during your tour too.

My first formal tour was a self-supported, fully loaded solo tour. I planned the ride so that at no point was I more then about 90 minutes from home by car. This gave me plenty of back-out options if the tour didn't work out for me. Since then I have helped others go on their first tours.

Here is a list of ideas that seem to work out well when planning your first tour.

- Furthest point within 90 minute car ride from home

By staying within a 90 minute car ride from home on your first tour you won't feel as bad about inconveniencing others should you need a lift home. You also won't feel as uncomfortable when you reach the farthest point and realize that you've only made it half-way.

- Leave with a tail or cross wind

During my first tour I lucked out and experienced a tail wind during my first day. I also set a new distance record for me at the time of 93 km in just over 3 hours. Having a tail wind on day one makes the ride easier and it will help with the other days when you get to face a head wind. Be careful through not to let the tail wind carry you far beyond the distance you want to travel back in the next day or two. 

During my Riding the Tailwind Triangle tour my friend and I experienced two days of amazing tailwinds before turning into a headwind on the last day headed for home. This was his first successfully completed tour and he had a blast (literally and figuratively). He regularily talks about his plans for his next tour now. 

- Try to leave and return on a sunny weather day

I have started tours in rain. In fact during my Round Lake Erie tour I outran the same rain storm four times during my first day as I zig zagged down country roads.

For a first tour aim for good weather. Riding a country road in shorts and a t-shirt with sunshine beaming down (on to your sunscreen of course) is a very enjoyable experience. The same goes for the last day if possible. The last day of any tour is very memorable but even more so when you return home with the sun shining and a smile on your face. 

- Consider doing a circle tour where you leave from home and return to your home by bicycle

Few things are nicer then knowing that you left from home by your bicycle, travelled some distance and then returned again all while riding your bicycle. Setting up your first tour this way also eliminates the need to worry about parking a car etc. (To be honest it also makes for an even more impressive story to tell your friends and family. You went how far on your bike?). 

- Have flexible and reasonable goals

During my first tour I aimed for Port Burwell Provincial park in Ontario as the ending point of my first day. In reality I also had another campsite picked out that was about half-way to Port Burwell. When I reached the first campground I had the option of stopping or continuing. I continued but I easily could have stopped instead.

- Be comfortable with your bike

Whenever you leave town on a bicycle a natural concern is whether or not the bike will get you home safely. Why not take the bike in for a quick tune-up a couple of weeks before your tour? Make sure you tell the bike shop about your touring intentions. The cost of a tune-up will usually be minimal and the peace of mind from having someone look over your bike will certainly make you feel better. 

- Bring your friends or family along

This one could be a double-edged sword. I like the flexibility of riding a solo tour and I actually rode my first tour completely solo (although I did meet another touring cyclist on that tour too). 

Other people really want someone else along so that if problems occur there is someone else there to assist. A second reason that's often mentioned is the desire to have companionship.

Bringing your family along could involve them riding their bikes too, just like the Feldmann and Gagnon family's or it could involve you riding your bike and meeting your vehicle driven family at the campground at the end of the day. 

- Make sure that you have fun!

I've purposely left this one to the end even through it's the most important point in my opinion! For me a bicycle tour should be about having fun and enjoying yourself. I find on tour that if I'm not having a good time then something needs to change so that I am once again having fun. Sometimes this means stopping for lunch, visiting a museum or just plain stopping for the day early. 

For me a bicycle tour is about the experience. It's much more important that the experience be an enjoyable one filled with fun times then it is that I cover 4 zillion miles although if I need to cover 4 zillion miles to return home then I certainly have to do that too. (grin) 
Hopefully you've noticed that on this page about planning your first tour I haven't said that you need the best bike, latest gear or any thing special. All of that will come with time provided that you have an enjoyable experience and you feel that your current gear needs an upgrade.

Bicycle touring is an enjoyable activity that is well within everyone's reach provided that you have a bicycle and an interest in trying something different.


## What should be your average daily distance during a bicycle tour?
One of the most common questions that new bicycle tourists ask about relates to the actual distance that they should plan on traveling each day of their tour. Almost always the right answer comes back. This answer is that the average daily distance that you should travel during a tour is the distance that you feel comfortable covering and that meets your personal goals.

Although this is the "right" answer and one that eventually you will formulate on your own for each tour that you go on it doesn't really give you very much help when planning your very first tour so I'll give you a set of rough guidelines to consider.

Most cross continental cyclists describe their average day as being anywhere from 120 to 140 km in length although most have pushed for the occasional longer day and all report at least a couple shorter distance days. These shorter and longer days are usually connected in some way with a planned rest day.

My longest riding day so far was 187.81 km of riding on a day with no real winds or hills to speak of. When you consider driving 187 km in a car that seems like an incredibly long distance partly due to the sheer boredom of just sitting there, pressing the pedal and holding the steering wheel for so long. On a bike 187 km is a long distance but a very enjoyable one as you enjoy the scenery along the way. Still to complete that distance in a day you have to give up other opportunities like stopping at museums, meeting people etc compared to a shorter distance day.

There are numerous examples in web journals of people going for even longer days but as you read the pages you will find that their tours were more focused on distance to be covered or a very tight schedule that allows little room for shorter distance days. In fact during my Round Lake Michigan tour I setup my tour the same way with a requirement to cover 160 km per day with two rest days. This forced me to ride from early in the morning to almost dark if I wanted to ride the distance, meet people and see the sights along the way. Ultimately I gave up a rest day so that I could reduce my daily distance and enjoy the ride more each day.

Whenever I introduce someone to touring for the first time I typically aim for 50 km days. I find that this distance is enough to give them a real sense of accomplishment while still allowing them plenty of time to stop for rests, visit sights of interest, talk with people and laze around camp at the beginning and ending of the day.

Each tour I plan for a different average daily distance in accordance with my goals. For my longer tours when I am trying to round a great lake or something similar within a set amount of vacation time I try to plan for average days of 120 km per day. This is a nice distance that gives me plenty of time to do the things that I like to do.

For weekend tours I usually aim for shorter distances of from 80 to 100 km per day. This still gives me plenty of riding along with lots of free time. As the longer days of summer recede I have to take into account the shorter daylight riding time as well so this decision tends to fit well within that need.

When planning your touring daily distance don't forget to take into account the need for rest days at reasonable intervals and the likelihood for strong head winds and severe weather. During that same Lake Michigan tour I was lucky enough to only encounter one day of seriously strong headwinds. On that day I was lucky to average 6.6 miles per hour at one point and I ended the day after only 88 km, far below my hoped for 160 - 200 for the day.

If you were asking me for a specific recommendation on the distance to consider for your first tour then I would likely recommend a relatively short daily distance of 50 km per day. If your first tour was planned to be a longer, multiple week/month tour then I would still recommend starting at 50 km per day for the first few days anyway before gradually ramping up to the 100 to 120 km per day that most cross continental cyclists seem to prefer.

One last comment that often haunts me during a bicycle tour was passed on to me by a cross continental cyclist.

He started out by mentioning the sorrow he felt for people who saw the world only through the windows of an airplane speeding from one place to another. He felt that for those people the trip was about the destination.

He went on to talk about bicycle touring as being more about the journey and less about the destination but he mentioned that as the daily distances increased your ability to see the world really decreased. He mentioned the numerous roads that looked interesting that he passed by, the museums that he failed to visit and the people that he didn't meet along the way.

He left after making a comment that as he has grown as a bicycle tourist he has steered away from the longer distances and much more towards shorter distances and lots of free time. In this way he can explore and visit as he much as he wants without being on a tight time leash ultimately making him a much more fulfilled person.

Interesting words indeed and worth consideration. I believe that he crossed two continents to come up with them fully.

## Getting physically prepared for your next major tour
One of the more common questions that comes in relates to preparing yourself for the incredible hardships of your next major tour. Of course most people worry and frit about how to prepare before they tour for the first time and then rapidly discover that bicycle touring is most of the time only as physically challenging as you want to make it.

A lot of people aim for high distance days or high daily elevation counts begging the question of why? There are invariably a number of answers but they all tend to boil down to a personal choice.

"You train for the tour or the tour trains you" is a common phrase that basically refers to the personal decision people make to either accept a few rougher days in the beginning of a long tour or to give up some precious free time prior to a tour to get some training in advance.

When I tour I typically like the idea of covering approximately 100 - 120 km per day. I also aim to have at least one 160+ km day if it turns out that the opportunity presents itself. Most of my tours involve some pre-tour training but I have also gone on one major tour without my usual advance training. The first few days were rougher then expected but three weeks later I was in stride. Probably the best reason for training in advance is that it makes it easier to really enjoy the world around you rather then becoming fixed on how far you still have left to go.

My next major tour is about three months away so I am just now stepping up my training program. I've decided to share it with you. I should emphasize that the following works for me but since all individuals are different you should use your own common sense when deciding what elements, if any, you care to utilize yourself.

- Early third of training time (first month in this case)
  - Ride twenty km per day minimum five days a week. I commute via bicycle so this is an easy requirement for me. Remember that another saying is that the distance you usually ride in a week is often the distance that you can easily cover on your first day touring. Most of my riding at this point is road riding with a mix of riding my geared touring bike and riding my fixed gear bike gradually increasing the cog size as time passes
  - Full body weight training with emphasis on exercising my entire body with modest weight but lots of repetitions one or two times per week taking about 45 to 60 minutes each session. I find that barbell workouts are relatively inexpensive and can be performed safely at home
  - Gentle stretching of all body areas to help increase flexibility. I always do this after a ride when the muscles are already warm. I believe that this reduces the chance of muscle injury while touring. Two or three times per week for about 20 minutes each time.
  - Add at least one core body activity session each week. Core body refers to exercises that strengthen your abs and your back muscles both areas that apparently go a long way towards helping keep long days in the saddle comfortable
  - Increased rest to allow my body the time it needs to recuperate fully from the extra effort I am giving it
  - Since I live in an apartment building I have added a daily requirement to climb at least 11 flights of stairs. This exercise occurs after my ride home so my muscles are already warmed up plus the climb causes some repetitive movements that really seem to help my legs over time
  - Better attention to food intake with emphasis on nutritious meals and smaller portions. Generally I eat too much so embarking on a gentle program of reduced intake allows me to become better prepared for the upcoming ride. My reduction is very small and with the weight workouts that I am doing I am not concerned about potential muscle loss
  - Improved water intake. Most of us don't drink enough water. I make it much more of a habit to consume water more often and in all cases I want to take in enough water to have clear urine
  - At some point in this phase and usually towards the end of the first third I plan a weekend tour with daily distances of approximately 100 km per day. This gives me a taste of the upcoming touring experience as both a reward and as an attempt to see how my program is working for me. I also get the chance to test out my bicycle, my camping gear and anything else that I intend to take with me on my major tour
- Second third of training time (second month in this case)
  - Increase riding time gradually by adding in small sections to my daily commute with the ultimate goal to add somewhere between 10 and 20 kilometers daily. Since this added distance is actually occuring over two rides it doesn't take much time to add in the extra bits. I also look for hill climbing opportunities as much as possible
  - Increase the amount of off road riding that I do. I find that doing more off road riding gives me the opportunity to do more interval like riding with bursts of coasting along coupled with moments of high intensity. This also does wonders for improving reaction times in tricky terrain which directly relates to handling awful roads while propelling a fully loaded touring bike. The last benefit is that it nicely refreshes mental energy just from the sheer difference of the ride itself
  - Increase weight training to three times per week still staying focused on a full body workout with lots of repetitions and modest weight. I am seeking strength and endurance but not necessarily bulk
  - Stretching exercises once each day usually after the morning ride. Each individual session takes only a small amount of time but certainly goes a long way towards increasing my overall flexibility. I always do the stretches after a ride so that the muscles are already warmed up and hopefully less prone to injury
  - Continued attention to nutrition, rest and hydration
  - A second tour is planned towards the end of this training period. The emphasis on this tour is strictly to enjoy myself and give my gear one last test before the actual tour begins
- Final third (third month in my case)
  - I maintain the extended daily riding time mentioned in the previous section but also include at least one 50 km ride per week, preferably two
  - Reduced emphasis on weight training
  - Reduced emphasis on core body exercises
  - Continued attention to stretching, nutrition, rest and hydration
  - More time with friends and family since these are the people I generally leave behind during a major tour
  
Wow! Looking at this typed out it looks like a very serious list but the execution of each of these things is really not too bad time wise since so much of it occurs as an added activity at the end of a ride. When you ride 20+ times a week it becomes really easy to add in small activities at the end of the ride when your muscles are already warmed up.

One key comment about this routine is that the core exercise is riding a bike. By bicycle commuting I am able to get to work in anywhere from the same amount of time to twice as much time as by car but with the benefit of getting my pre-tour training out of the way to mention just one of the benefits only.

Training before a tour isn't mandatory but it is something that I personally recommend. I've found that if you are in better shape the first day of your tour then your chances of really experiencing that first day in a positive manner are greatly improved!
