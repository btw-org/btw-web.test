## Need for Electricity on a Bicycle Tour
It's the 21st century and living without electricity is just primal. 

Yes, I've thought about it. I was going to leave the phone and take a paper map instead, 
but the plain old map doesn't show where I am now or where I am headed to. Navigation is important on a self-supported bicycle tour.

I want to see the satellite view before I select my camping spot. 
I want to take pictures. I want to upload those pictures to my social media profiles.
I want to find the nearest point of interest without asking locals, or I just want to surf the internet when I'm bored while camping. 

These all require a constant supply of power, and we are going to find and carry that power with us.


## Sources of Electricity
There are multiple ways to get the electricity you need on a bike tour. All of them have their advantages and disadvantages. 

If you need to be a **completely self-sufficient bicycle traveler**, a solar panel would be a great choice, as long as there is sunlight.
  
A wheel dynamo is also a good option, especially if you are touring in winter, but it doesn't work when you are off the bike 
and it adds extra weight and mechanical complexity.

Charging your equipment while you are in a cafe or while staying in a hotel, in my opinion, is the last option.
Carrying less weight may seem attractive but searching for a place to charge your phone when you really need it is unpleasant. 

Other exotic ways to get electricity do exist. And I will briefly talk about them, but tried and tested methods are always better.

<br />

### Electricity from Solar Chargers
Using a **solar charger** is the best way to keep your electronics charged on a bike tour. 
There are different types of solar panels on the market; 
foldable solar panels, rollable solar panels, power-bank-integrated solar panels, and flexible solar panels.

The most common type is the **foldable solar panel** because of its high power output and cheap price.

A 15-watt foldable solar panel is my best friend when I'm on a tour. 
I attach it to the rear rack and connect my power bank to charge it during the day.

Generated power reduces considerably when the weather is cloudy but it's not completely useless. 
Most solar panels have an integrated safety system to cut the power if it can't provide enough voltage.

I'm currently using the Blitzwolf 15W Solar Charger, but I think the product has been discontinued.

<div class = "product" markdown = "1">
**Nekteck 21W Solar Charger**  
{% include lazy-image.html file="bike-touring-solar-panel-1" side="left" alt="Solar panel for bicycle touring" caption="" %}
One of the most purchased foldable solar panels on Amazon is the Nekteck 21W Solar Charger.

This solar panel rated at 21W and it provides enough power to charge two devices simultaneously.
It can detect the device and send 1 or 2 Amperes per port accordingly for fast charging. (Up to 3A overall.)
It's only 18oz, and its dimensions are 6.3" x 11.1" x 1.06" folded, or 26.3" x 11.1" opened.

It has good reviews and has enough power to charge your power bank, phone, camera, etc.

<div class = "product" markdown = "1">
**Foxelli Dual USB Solar Charger 10W**  
{% include lazy-image.html file="bicycle-touring-solar-panel-2" side="left" alt="Bike touring solar charger" caption="" %}
A lighter option is the 'Foxelli Dual USB Solar Charger 10W', but it has a lower power output as you can see. 

This solar panel also has two USB ports to charge two devices simultaneously. The power output is not much, but it can provide up to 1.85A in total.
It weighs 1.10 lbs. and is 1.2" thick when folded. It's water resistant so you don't have to worry when it starts to rain.

If use your smartphone for everything, this solar panel is enough for you.

### Electricity from a Bicycle Dynamo
Some people prefer a dynamo because works even in bad weather. 
But it adds complexity to your bike, and installing it requires a complete rebuild of the front wheel.
The generated power is way too low compared to its weight. Dynamo hubs are at least a pound heavier than regular hubs. 
Dynamo hubs are useful for front and backlights, but they are not enough to charge your high-power electronic equipment.

Since it's not a popular choice, there are not many options for a bicycle dynamo. Here are two of the most purchased dynamo hubs:

<div class = "product" markdown = "1">

**SHIMANO Nexus Dynamo Bicycle Hub**  
{% include lazy-image.html file="bike-touring-dynamo-hub-1" side="left" alt="dynamo hub for bicycle touring" caption="" %}

The average power generated is 3 watts per hour, which is not even enough to charge one standard USB powered equipment 
so you have to store it as you ride to use later. You need to visit your local bike shop to install the dynamo hub.

This dynamo hub is only for V-Brake systems, so if you are using disc brakes you need to buy the other hub (next in the article).

[<button class = 'button-success button-block'>SHIMANO Nexus Dynamo Bicycle Hub</button>](https://www.amazon.com/SHIMANO-Nexus-Dynamo-Bicycle-Hub/dp/B002J9AE2E/){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} 

</div>


<div class = "product" markdown = "1">

**SHIMANO DH-S501 Alfine Dynamo Disc Hub**  
{% include lazy-image.html file="bicycle-tour-dynamo-2" side="left" alt="bike touring dynamo" caption="" %}

The average power generated is 3 watts, again, it is not enough for multiple devices. You have to store the generated electricity to
use it later continuously. And installing the dynamo hub requires a complete rebuild of the front wheel.

This dynamo hub is disc brake compatible. 

[<button class = 'button-success button-block'>SHIMANO DH-S501 Alfine Dynamo Disc Hub</button>](https://www.amazon.com/SHIMANO-DH-S501-Alfine-Dynamo-Disc/dp/B0037N4ZYO/){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}

### Electricity from Camp Fire
With the advent of technology, people invent all kinds of things. 
You can charge your electronics over a campfire with this special stove:

<div class = "product" markdown = "1">
**BioLite CampStove 2 Wood Burning & USB Charging Camp Stove**  
{% include lazy-image.html file="biolite-electricity-bike-tour" side="left" alt="electricity on a bicycle tour" caption="" %}

The BioLite CampStove uses a Peltier module to generate electricity from the heat difference between two sides of the module. 

Using sticks or other biomass, it can power most USB-chargeable devices including cell phones and smartphones. 
This is very useful on backpacking and camping trips, or during power outages.
20 minutes of charging with a strong fire gives you about 60 minutes of talk time on most smartphones.
CampStove weighs about 2 pounds and is about the same size as a 2-liter Nalgene water bottle.
An internal starter battery helps kick-start the wood fire before the stove begins generating its own power.

[<button class = 'button-success button-block'>BioLite CampStove 2 Wood Burning & USB Charging Camp Stove</button>](https://www.amazon.com/BioLite-CampStove-Campstove-Burning-Charging/dp/B019WDE9HU/){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} 

</div>

This is unnecessary weight for a solo bike traveler but if you are traveling with a group and your campfire is alive all night; this stove might be 
an option. It still needs fire to work and because of this, it cannot be used when it's raining or if wood is not available at all.


<br />

### Fuel Cells
It's a futuristic technology, but it exists. The most common type is hydrogen fuel cell which obviously runs on hydrogen. 

Forget it, there is still time for that.

### Cafes & Hotels
You can charge your equipment for free while you drink your morning coffee in a café, or while staying in a hotel from time to time. 
**A high-capacity power bank** is very useful if you rely on the electricity grid.

You can always ask locals to help charge your phone or power bank; they'll be happy to help.

<br />


## Energy Storage
Finding electricity is no longer a problem, but now, you need to store the energy to use it later. 
If you are using a solar panel or a dynamo to generate electricity, you can charge your electronics while you are sleeping with the help of a **power bank**.

When it rains, or the weather is cloudy for days, your solar charger becomes practically useless. And when you take a day off biking, your dynamo is also useless.
There are way too many options for storing energy but the cheapest and most widely used ones are rechargeable power banks and 
non-rechargeable primary batteries.

### Power Banks
The easiest and most sustainable way to carry power with you all the time is using a **high-capacity power bank**. 
I use a 20,000 mAh rechargeable power bank which lasts me a week.
The thing is; you need a matching power source to charge it. It takes 20 hours to charge my power bank from a wall outlet and it is way slower 
with a solar panel. Not because the solar panel is not enough, but the sun will disappear when you need it. 

<div class = "product" markdown = "1">

**BONAI Portable Charger 30000mAh**  
{% include lazy-image.html file="bike-tour-power-bank" side="left" alt="portable charger for bicycle touring" caption="" %}

This charger has 4 USB ports with a 5V / 5.6A output so you can charge up to 4 equipment at the same time.
With this 30000mAh capacity, you can charge a 3000mAh phone 10 times. (Not exactly 10 times because of inefficiencies, but I can safely say 8 times for sure.)
The power bank has built-in LED flashlight which is bright enough to help in emergency situations. 
The metal body protects it from dust, knocking, and dropping.


[<button class = 'button-success button-block'>BONAI Portable Charger 30000mAh</button>](https://www.amazon.com/BONAI-Flashlight-High-Speed-Technology-Samsung-Black/dp/B07HQJSSDR/){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} 

</div>


<div class = "product" markdown = "1">

**myCharge AdventureMega Portable Charger 20100mAh**  
{% include lazy-image.html file="power-bank-bike-touring" side="left" alt="powerbank on bicycle tour" caption="" %}

It has up to 2.4A of shared output power for its two USB ports.
The charger is water-resistant, drop-resistant, and dirt-proof; a perfect choice for your bike tour.
It has built-in carabiners to attach it to your bike easily.  
Dimensions: 6.95 in x 2.99 in x 1.06 in  
Product Weight: 1.04 lbs.

[<button class = 'button-success button-block'>myCharge AdventureMega Portable Charger 20100mAh</button>](https://www.amazon.com/myCharge-AdventureMega-Portable-20100mAh-Accessories/dp/B07KQWJJ2W/){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} 

</div>

<div class = "product" markdown = "1">

**Poweradd Slim 2 Most Compact 5000mAh**  
{% include lazy-image.html file="lightweight-powerbank-bicycle-tour" side="left" alt="portable charger power bank" caption="" %}

This power bank can provide up to 2.1A in total. It's light and tiny, with these dimensions: 3.9" x 1.3" x 1.2".
It's slim and can fit in small bags such as top tube bags or handlebar bags.

You can use two of them for added capacity, or charge your phone with one of them while the other one is still being charged from the solar charger.

[<button class = 'button-success button-block'>Poweradd Slim 2 Most Compact 5000mAh</button>](https://www.amazon.com/Upgraded-Poweradd-Compact-External-Portable/dp/B00KG45W08/){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} 

</div>

<br />


### Replaceable Batteries
Some old equipment such as cameras and navigation devices may use non-rechargeable primary batteries and I strongly suggest you sell that antique
stuff and buy new ones with rechargeable batteries. Primary batteries are heavier than lithium-based rechargeable batteries, and they cost more in the long run.
Disposing of replaceable batteries is also a problem. We are **bicycle travelers**, we should care about the environment more.

You can charge your electronics from replaceable batteries by using this device if you absolutely need to.

<div class = "product" markdown = "1">
**Verbatim AA Power Pack**  
{% include lazy-image.html file="charging-with-replaceable-batteries" side="left" alt="replaceable batteries on bike tour" caption="" %}

AA Power pack works with any AA battery, alkaline or rechargeable, providing the ultimate convenience in emergency power in your travel bag. 
Just add 4 x AA batteries to start using and charging your phone, headset or other devices.

The product comes with a 1-year limited warranty and technical support.

[<button class = 'button-success button-block'>Verbatim AA Power Pack on Amazon</button>](https://www.amazon.com/Verbatim-Power-Bank-Charger-97928/dp/B007MLHS2S){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} 

</div>

<br />

That's all. Now it's your choice; go off the grid or carry your own grid with you!
