At the end of the day during a *long distance bicycle touring adventure* you want to experience a nice 
restful sleep so that the next morning you will be ready to get back on the bike and head out into the world once again.

For some people a nice air conditioned room in a hotel or motel holds the key to happiness.

For others the lure of the great outdoors beckons them to spend some time outside listening to the 
frogs croak and the bugs chatter. Morning is often accompanied by the sound of birds singing and roosters crowing.

<!-- more -->

This page discusses the various shelters that are available and often used during a bicycle touring adventure. 
Examples include **hammocks, tents, tipi's, bivy sacks, tarps and of course just sleeping outside with nothing more then a blanket or sleeping bag**.

Some things to consider when choosing your shelter type include protection from the elements, 
privacy, safety, comfort and of course the physical characteristics of your choice in terms 
of weight and bulk to name just two.

You should also consider the time of year that you will be travelling in. Choices for winter time camping 
are not usually the same ones you would make for a summer time adventure.



## Hammocks
Just before leaving home to circle Lake Erie on a bicycle touring adventure I decided that I wanted to reduce 
the weight I was carrying on the bike. One very good candidate for a drastic weight reduction was my tent.

At the time I was using a relatively roomy two person tent that came with a huge vestibule. Between the poles, 
tent pegs, the fly and of course the main body of the tent I felt like the tent weighed about ten pounds.

Additionally the length of the poles were longer then my saddlebags were high so I always ended up carrying that weight on top of my rear rack.

I narrowed my choices down to two different types of shelters. One was a small tent called the MSR Microzoid. 
I actually found one setup in demo mode at a Mountain Equipment Co-op in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 
Grabbing a thermarest from the nearby display I proceeded to try out the tent by laying down inside it. It seemed like a rather tight fit.

That comment is funny in light of my final decision. I returned home and did some more looking. Just as 
I was about to purchase the tent anyway I learned of the Hennessy Hammock.

### Opinions about the hammock
#### Description

The Ultra-light backpacker version of this hammock weighs 1.5 pounds, can be setup between two trees 
up to 30 feet apart and includes a fly, bug netting and for me a very comfortable nights sleep. 
As an added bonus it comes in a nice dark brown making it ideal for camping in places where you would prefer 
not to be bothered. Some people might even use these for Stealth camping.

#### Options

There are a number of options available for the hammock including the longer lines already mentioned above, 
snakeskins that make setting up and taking down the hammock incredibly easy as well as giving some additional 
protection from rain and varying lengths of tree-hugger webbing straps to facilitate going around different sized tree trunks.

For cool to cold weather camping there are also attachments that add insulation to the hammock. The devices 
consist of an underpad, an overcover and an undercover. I have these devices although I haven't yet tried them out.


#### How well does it work?

During my Round Lake Erie bicycle tour I watched a rapid weather change occur while camped just above the exposed 
cliff face of South Bass Island. Lightening was crashing all around and the trees were shaking initially from 
the wind and then later from the lengthly downpour that lasted throughout the night.

At first I wondered how well the hammock would handle such an exposed position in a storm with winds 
raging upwards of 80 km/hr (as I discovered the next morning). After five to ten minutes I stopped worrying 
and fell asleep to enjoy a nice, dry and relaxing night. In the morning I woke up to discover that 
the sleeping bag and the inside of the hammock were **completely dry**.

Unfortunately for the occupants of three nearby tents, including two high end new ones, 
they had the joy of waking up wet and needing some drying time.

I experienced more storms while camping on other tours including my touring adventure around Lake Huron. So far I haven't woken up wet yet!

#### How hard is it to setup and take down?

I can setup and take down the hammock in less time then most people can do the same with a tent. 
I also have many more options for setup when compared to a tent. I don't worry about the slope 
of the ground and I have no need for a flat, cleared space. As long as there are trees and 
I can run the lines then I have an easy time.

I intend to write an actual article detailing how to setup the hammock showing the snakeskins, tarp, 
lines and how to tie the single knot that is needed. I will add the link once it's available.

#### What if there are no trees around?

Some people have used walking sticks to hold the hammock off the ground at the ends. 
This prevents the netting from hitting your face and allows you to use the hammock as a bivy sack. 
This is discussed on the Hennessy web site.

A similar thing could be done using two picnic tables or possibly a picnic table and the bike. 
I need to do some experimenting but I don't see why it wouldn't work.

I have always been able to find trees on my tours so it hasn't been a problem. If you are concerned then make 
sure that you obtain the extra long ropes that allow you to hang the hammock from trees up to 30 feet apart.


#### Tips and tricks

I always bring my thermarest along with me. Hammocks are surprisingly good at transferring heat from your body 
to the surrounding air. The extra insulation from the pad is very useful on all but the very hottest days. 
Having the thermarest along also gives me more comfort should I need to sleep on the ground due to missing trees. 
When using it in the hammock it's generally almost completed deflated.

The ultra-lite version of the hammock has a 200 pound limit (please verify this). This weight includes you and any gear 
that you bring in the hammock with you. If you need to hold more weight than 200 pounds there are other hammocks available.

Brian Petritsch contacted me after this article was created and added the following comments about his experiences with hammocks.

> I think the major reason you sleep so well in the hammock is because of the even support. 
When tent camping I'm always tossing and turning **because of discomfort at the pressure points**. 
I could sleep on rocks when I was younger but I'm 49 now. A lot of times I'll wake up and my arms or legs are asleep.
<br><br>
The hammock cradles you and puts even pressure across the whole contact area of your body, 
destributing your weight. I noticed some cold spots in the 15 or so times I used it last year. 
So I bought the under cover and pad to take care of that. I got the overcover because "you never know."
<br><br>
You have to train yourself how to get into your sleeping bag in one of these. 
The first night can be rather flustrating. Another major advantage is the compactness. 
I was able to take a few pounds off the bike. Plus I can stuff it in a front bag taking the weight 
off of the back tire and lowering the bikes center of gravity.

---

Brian has also purchased the **overcover, undercover and the underpad**. Unlike me he has already had an opportunity 
to give them a try. Here's what he had to say about his experience.

> I bought the undercover , overcover and pad but hadn't had a chance to check them out till this weekend. 
I was sick of being in the house so I figured I'd get a short distance from the house and check out the new gear. 
I wanted to be far enough away so I'd give it a decent try and close enough to make it home before I froze to death.
<br><br>
The night was clear and the temp dropped down to 36 F. I was using a 15 degree bag, fleece pants and jacket 
and a regular cotton sheet as a bag liner. Along with the underpad I stuck in a space blanket. 
My pressure points still got cool but not overly so. Once I took the sheet and put all of it under me I was fine. 
Of course that little trip to the men's tree first thing in the morning was a little brisk!:)
<br><br>
The over cover is worth the extra coin as it did keep the inside toasty. When you move you can definitely 
hear the air below in the hammock. It was rather wet up by the head end in the morning but took just minutes 
to dry out once the sun made it into my site. For the first time since I got the Hennessy, there was dew on 
the bottom side of my fly. I was able to brush most of it off before it thawed. This was probably because 
I tied in tight to the hammock to minimalize cold air flow.
<br><br>
Seeing how most of my camping will be done in warmer weather I believe the new cold weather system is a success. 
I did have a little trouble with the hammock getting twisted around the ridge line and because the undercover 
hid it I had a little trouble figuring out what was going on. Then again I was setting this up by moonlight and I couldn't see that well.
<br><br>
I also purchased the longer straps so now I can swing from Canadian size trees!

### Hammock danger

It was a dark and stormy night when I started putting up my hammock in preparation for a night of restful and dry sleep. 
The rain was driving downwards with the intensity of a high pressure shower drastically limiting visibility especially 
when looking upwards. I chose a likely set of stout looking trees. The trunks felt strong and were certainly more 
then thick enough based on my previous experience hanging a hammock.

Eventually the hammock rose between the two trees and it's welcoming dry interior drew me like a moth to a flame. 
Just before climbing inside I performed my routine check of applying some downward pressure to the hammock to help 
pretighten the lines. Everything seemed snuck and ready to go.

After changing into my sleeping clothes I climbed in to the hammock in anticipation of a good sleep. 
Unfortunately **the next few seconds were impacted by the descend of the hammock to the ground in a jerky, 
ratchet-like manner followed less then a second later by an incredibly lound crashing noise as one of the 
supporting trees crashed to the ground a foot away from where I ended up in the hammock**.

After this shaky first attempt the driving rain forced me to restring the hammock between two 
more trees and attempt to have a restful night despite the close call. Had that tree landed on me then 
I could easily have been injured or even killed.

<figure>  
  <img src = "/public/images/{{page.slug}}/HammockTree.jpg"  alt = "Hammock Tree Fall" />
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>


The next morning I checked out the tree in strong sunlight. It quickly became apparent that the 
tree I chose in the rain had some internal issues in the trunk that had greatly weakened it. 
The tree was also surrounded tightly on all sides by other trees making it difficult to see above the lowest branches. 
It was the tight intervweave of the surrounding branches that likely prevented the tree from **coming down directly on the hammock**. 
The problematic tree had no branches at the lower levels but higher up I could see dead ones showing that the tree had likely died some 
time before I arrived. The weight of the tree was quite heavy and had I been underneath it trying to 
push it up then I believe that I would have experienced an incredible amount of trouble getting out from underneath it.

I was using a Hennessy Hammock at the time of this incident but it wouldn't have been any different had 
I been using a different hammock type. Once my weight was applied to the hammock the trees were forced to either carry 
the weight or collapse. For the first time a tree chose to opt out and had I been in a less densely forested 
area it's very likely **the tree would have landed directly on me**. By the time the tree is speeding towards 
the ground it's really too late to do anything about it.

Protecting yourself against this problem seems deceptively simply. Take the time to look very carefully 
at any tree that you intend to attach your hammock to. Look for signs of damage, holes in the trunk and 
of course the presence of dead branches above. These are things I had always done in the past and that 
I intend to continue to do moving forward. I believe that in this case a major contributing factor was not being able to really 
look up and see the dead branches due to the driving rain.

This event occured last summer prior to my Lake Ontario tour. 
I went on to use the hammock another ten times without any problems. I intend to use it again this summer during all of my tours.


### A hammock and no trees

During my Round Lake Erie tour I came to a state park in southern Michigan that had no large trees in 
the camp site area for me to hang my hammock. It was raining that night and the park staff decided 
to grant my request to camp amongst the large trees in the beach area rather then make me 
use my hammock as a bivy sack along the ground.

Last year I circled Lake Ontario and unfortunately I visited two camp sites that didn't allow 
hammocks to be attached to trees. One was in New York State at a state park north of Niagara Falls while 
the second one was in Ontario at a conservation area in Toronto.

<figure class = "fig_leftimg">  
  <img src = "/public/images/{{page.slug}}/HammockWithoutTree.jpg"  alt = "Hammock Without Tree" />
  <figcaption>My hammock setup for sleeping on the ground. On the right you can see it attached to the sign post. Off picture on the left it is connected to the picnic table.</figcaption>
</figure>

Luckily using a hammock isn't really that difficult. The entire trick is to get the hammock 
fly and bug netting above your face. You can do this rather easily using sticks, picnic tables, 
signposts and other similar objects. Remember that you don't need the objects to hold 
your weight and the weight of the hammock. All that you really need is enough tension in 
the main line to hold the stuff off your face. Some people like to take walking sticks or light 
tent poles along on tour so that if they end up in a region where trees are scarce then they 
have an easier, more controlled way to get everything setup.

<figure class = "fig_rightimg">  
  <img src = "/public/images/{{page.slug}}/HammockWithoutTree2.jpg"  alt = "Hammock Without Tree2" />
  <figcaption>Another shot of the same setup. This picture was taken during a windy period just before I tightened up the sides.</figcaption>
</figure>

The other problem is related to how hard the ground will feel when compared to the wonderful luxury 
of a hammock in the air. For me this wasn't a real problem either because I still bring a Thermarest 
pad on tour with me. I carry it because hammocks are very, very efficient at removing heat. 
By taking along the Thermarest I obtain the ability to have it protect me from large heat loss and 
mosquito bites through the hammock's outer skin. While there are other, lighter options available 
few of them can also act as a reasonably comfortable cushion against the hard ground.

Remember that out of well over 117 hammock sessions I have only experienced two times when 
I was required to sleep on the ground. With all the convenience that I obtain from a hammock 
and the vastly improved sleeping experience I receive when I use one I fully intend to keep on taking it with me.




## Choosing a tent
Your choice of tent is one of the most important equipment decisions you have to make. 
A strong tent will stand you in good stead, but be prepared to pay upwards of £200/300 Euros 
or about $300 in the United States. Yes, you can get nice tents for less, certainly in the USA, 
but in this case we are talking about paying full retail for comparison's sake.

A cheaper tent may well stand you in good stead for many short summer trips, but the purpose of this 
article is to focus on tents which will last longer and in tougher conditions. I have seen plenty of 
cheap tents **destroyed in a moment** by strong winds, or leaking, tearing, splitting, broken poles etc.

Look at two person tents even if you are travelling solo; you’re going to spend a lot of time in your 
tent and you will need space in the tent for doing chores as well as for comfort. And who knows, you 
might have guests! There are some nice solo tents available which have large vestibules, alleviating 
the claustrophobia unless you have to zip everything up at night, but generally, they are not 
flexible or comfortable tents and ventilation can be difficult. If you are travelling as a couple 
you ought to think of a two to three person size and make sure the tent has a **large vestibule** for all 
your gear and for cooking in and **enough space** that you don’t fight!

Expect the weight to be 2.5-3kg including everything. It is not worth paying extra or giving up space or 
strength for the sub-two kilo tent; leave these to hard-core backpackers. An exception is if you 
are only looking for a one-person tent - take a look at Hilleberg's Akto if you can. If you are 
ordering a tent from the internet, check the weight figures carefully first; manufacturers' 
figures are often used by mail-order shops without checking and needless to say, manufacturers 
are often optimistic. You may learn a lot more from a visit to a specialist shop, fishing scales in hand.

**Aluminium poles** are the standard in good tents. Think about where you want to go on this and 
future trips. If you are definitely headed for mountains, consider a four-season tent; otherwise 
three-season tents are fine for the job and the better ones have been used by bikers going through the Himalayas.

As a rule, tents tend to be designed for the weather in the countries where they are made. 
European tents generally work well in the rain and cold weather, American tents ventilate well 
in hot weather and are often designed to stand up to strong winds. The better New Zealand tents 
have excellent rain protection and work well in the mountains. Top brands from the USA are The 
North Face, Sierra Designs, Marmot, and Mountain Hardwear. They all make some excellent four season 
and three+ season tents with three or four poles. Four season tents usually have steep roofs to shed 
snow and often have four poles to support a snowfall, and they typically have two doors to facilitate 
escape if you wake up to your front door covered by a snowdrift.

If this sounds like overkill for your type of travel, look at the stronger **three season models**, 
which may be more comfortable in terms of a high-volume shape and larger doors. If you can, choose 
a drab, natural coloured tent, which will draw less attention than a bright coloured mountain tent.

High quality European names are Vaude and Salewa of Germany, very expensive Hilleberg of Sweden, and 
Terra-Nova of the UK. Terra-nova’s Voyager tent is one of the most popular among those bikers who have 
either deep pockets or generous sponsors. Its virtues are **extreme strength and wind-resistance, extra 
length for tall people and a good vestibule to cook in**. Terra-Nova’s new Laserlarge tents are worth a 
look, but they are made of thinner material - take care on a long trip. Vaude tents are affordable, good 
all-rounders which are usually a natural shade of green. Salewa makes some classic mountain tents, strong 
and compact in design. Hilleberg is best known for its tunnel tents and are highly rated by their owners. 
The Nallo GT, for light weight and a large vestibule to cook in and store gear has been mentioned by 
numerous cycle-tourers, but it retails for 640 Euros! Hillebergs use a very thin nylon coated with silicone. 
They are more of a cold weather tent than a hot weather tent. New Zealand’s MacPac makes some of the best 
tents in the world. Their tents have extremely thick groundsheets and all their trekking tents perform well 
in high winds. The polyester flysheets don’t sag when they get wet. Their Minaret tent is a classic two 
person mountain tent, though a bicycle touring couple ought to go for the larger Olympus.

One design which works well for bikers is **the tunnel tent** such as the MacPac tents. These are especially 
sturdy if you pitch them lengthways into the wind. They also go up and come down quickly which is useful 
in high winds and rain, especially as the inner tent usually remains attached to the flysheet. You pack 
your panniers while inside the tent and jump out at the last minute to take down and pack the tent. The 
only disadvantage to tunnel tents is that they are not freestanding and must be pegged out to stand. 
People who take tunnel tents on long trips tend to grumble a bit when they pass through really high 
country and cannot get their tent pegs into rocky ground. Be inventive, **take extra nylon cord to lengthen 
the guylines so you can reach far enough to find some soft ground or tie your guylines around rocks**. 
Take extra tent pegs and a variety if possible for hard ground and soft ground. If your tent comes with 
pegs that bend easily, replace them all before you go.

Avoid ultra-light tents as there is usually a loss of strength and long-term durability, besides a much 
higher price. A recent long-term test of tents against ultraviolet light revealed that some of the most 
expensive and lightest tents fared the worst. Polyester flysheets generally held up better against UV 
damage but it was clear that the thicker flysheets did best of all and this is why the weight savings 
of tents below 2.5kg are not worth the extra expense, as you are giving up strength and long term durability.

There are a couple of tents designed with bikers in mind **with vestibules large enough to accommodate two bikes**. 
Covering your bike at night is a luxury rather than a necessity but these are high quality tents. 
Vaude’s Monolith is 3.8m long, weighs 4.4kg, and is a comfortable place to spend a rest day. MSR of the 
USA makes the Velo, a smaller tent of similar weight, but it is freestanding, although the vestibule must 
be pegged down. Terra-Nova’s Laser Large 2 also has a very large vestibule, which the makers claim will fit 
two bikes. All these tents are 3 season tents and have a large amount of fairly thin nylon in relation to 
just a few poles. Not recommended for windy places or mountain travel.

Whichever tent you choose, use an **extra groundsheet** underneath. It keeps mud off your tent and takes the 
beating your tent would otherwise receive. It reduces condensation under the tent floor so that when you 
pack up, your tent will be fairly dry underneath while the groundsheet will be damp on the side facing the ground. 
It's not necessary to buy the custom-fitted groundsheet made by the tent maker, they are expensive for what they are, 
and blue polythene tarps serve just as well and cost next to nothing.

If all this sounds like too much expense and a blow to the budget, go with what you already have, but if you are 
using a cheap tent, be more cautious choosing a campsite, avoiding open spaces, hills and beaches and sticking to 
campgrounds or woods where you can find a sheltered spot. You will meet lots of travellers with cheap and cheerful 
tents - we met a Japanese biker travelling down the Pacific Coast of the USA on **a bike for which he paid $20 and a 
tent which cost 75 cents**. It had no poles, so he had to find trees to tie the guylines to, but most important of all, 
it did not stop him making his trip. A German biker we met in New Zealand had a one pole tent, basically waterproof 
but he had to accept the odd blow-down every now and then, and sometimes had to spend a few hours drying things out. 
He told us he never worried, because he only spent the equivalent of €100 on the tent and felt he had nothing to lose.

Be sure to carry some SeamGrip in your repair kit. This urethane based glue is excellent for sealing seams on your tent. 
Most decent tents come with the seams already sealed (to prevent rain coming in through the stitching) but if you tent is not 
sealed, apply a thin bead of SeamGrip to the side of the tent which is not coated with the durable water repellent (DWR) coating, 
as glue will not stick easily to this side. SeamGrip makes excellent repairs, using either a repair kit or any piece of thin 
nylon or polyester, preferably matching the original material. The large tube will seal the seams of a tent, but this glue dries 
out quickly once opened and ages even if unused, so the small tubes, though more expensive, might be best for a road trip.


### Hydrostatic head

It is common nowadays to see figures given for the hydrostatic head of a flysheet or floor of a tent 
and this has become a useful measure for comparing the degree of water resistance of tents. The hydrostatic 
head figure gives the maximum vertical height of a column of water to which the fabric is waterproof, ie. 
The water pressure that the fabric can withstand. A tent floor of 10,000mm, ie water-resistant to a 
10m high column of water, is as strong as you are likely to find. Flysheets are obviously thinner than 
groundsheets, and 6-7000mm is a strong flysheet while 3000mm is adequate. Rolf Hilleberg, owner of 
Hilleberg, the tentmaker, warns that this test is not always performed to independent standards and buyers 
still need to be cautious in using these figures. Tents with thinner flysheets will still be waterproof, 
but the stronger the storm and the longer it lasts, the more likely they are to let water through. 
Over the tent’s lifetime, as the coating wears off and the nylon breaks down due to UV damage, lightweight 
tents will let in water sooner. It’s fine to buy a cheap tent for summer camping for a few weeks a year in 
Europe, but for a long expedition, a better quality tent, perhaps a little heavier, will last much longer.

### Tent pegs

Commonly overlooked, because they come with your tent so you don't need to choose them, tent pegs are what holds your 
tent up in a storm and for a long trip, it's worth getting good ones. From left to right, the choice of tent pegs covers 
the cheapest on the left to the best pegs on the market on the right. If your tent came with pegs like the example on the 
far left, **throw them in your recycling bin and get better ones**, and give some thought to whether the tent itself is good 
enough for extended touring. The second and third pegs along are made from steel and aluminium respectively. 
They are both light, good for general use and the easiest to put in and take out by hand but will bend in hard 
ground and on a long trip you may have to straighten them once a week by bashing them with a stone.

<figure>  
  <img src = "/public/images/{{page.slug}}/tentpegs.jpg"  alt = "Tent pegs" />
  <figcaption>Many different types of tent pegs are available depending on your needs.</figcaption>
</figure>

The peg in the middle is made of tent pole aluminium and is the most expensive. It is excellent in soft or hard 
ground, but not quite as strong as it looks (notice the bend in this one). Hit this peg hard off-centre and it 
can snap instantly. The big plastic pegs, usually yellow, are a very good for soft ground, sand or snow and if 
they are damaged, they can be sharpened or filed back into shape. The large aluminium peg to the right is 
reasonably light for its size and is designed for sand or snow. Its blunt tip makes it a poor performer on hard ground.

Recommendation for hard-core campers:

The peg on the far right is **far and away the strongest peg** I have used. It is not hand-friendly and needs 
pushing in with a boot sole or stone and pulling out with another tent peg or a loop of nylon, but it will 
not bend or break and is excellent in hard and soft ground. The V shape provides rigidity and gives it a 
lot of stickiness in soft ground. This is the only type of peg I use on most trips, but beware: it is not 
friendly to bare feet either.


### Comments from other travelers

> Just a couple of comments on tents. I use an inexpensive, sturdy tent by Coleman. 
In fact, I've decommissioned my 7x7 (veteran of 6 tours) and bought a 7x10. These tents are heavier; 
the 7x10 weighs about 8# (4Kg), but on a bike weight isn't as critical as it is in backpacking or boating. 
These tents are well designed and well made, and can be purchased for under US$60.
<br><br>
I bought the longer tent because I'm tall (6'4";/1.9M) and I want to avoid my head and feet 
touching the tent and getting wet. The 7X7 worked if I was alone, sleeping diagonally, but when 
my daughter was along the tent wasn't long enough.
<br><br>
For tent pegs, consider gutter spikes from a hardware store or lumber yard. They're light and sturdy.
<br><br>
Finally, I like freestanding tents. You don't need to carry a mallet for very secure staking, and a 2Kg tent plus a 1Kg mallet makes a 3Kg tent.

> For many years I used an Eureka Autumn Wind for canoe/kayak touring and car camping. These are the same design as 
MEC Tarns with the Autumn Wind just a bit larger than the Tarn 2. Very comfortable for one, bearable short term for two. 
The shape is very efficient, with good floor area for the weight and height only where its needed. This tent stood up 
to winds on the south west coast of Newfoundland than trashed some "4-season" designs.
<br><br>
As I've aged, I've grown to dislike the single door/ front vestibule design. One is always having to turn around in 
the tent it seems. If the ground is sloping, one normally pitches with head end slightly higher. I found putting on 
my shoes and getting out while my feet were higher than my butt was a real struggle! This is especially true when 
still a bit stiff after first waking up in the morning.
<br><br>
Now my tent of choice for kayak tripping is a North Face Mountain 25. This thing is built like a tank. A door and 
vestibule at each end makes it very convenient. Its too heavy for solo bike touring though at about 9 lbs and is tight for two.
<br><br>
I've just purchased a Cabela's XPG-1 for solo bike trips. Despite the hunting and fishing store brand, it's a very 
well constructed tent, with vents through the fly, lots of mesh, bathtub floor, reflective guylines, etc. In some 
ways I wish it was less well constructed as they could have saved a bit of weight with lighter grade webbing, fewer 
buckles, etc. Even still it comes in at just a bit over 4 lbs. Backpacker magazine gave it a very good review in 2004 
and it was a bargain at under US$100. The tent itself is fairly narrow but long enough to keep some gear above your head. 
The door and a vestibule as wide as the tent itself are on the side. This makes for easy entry and exit as well as good 
access to gear. I'm looking forward to trying it out!
<br><br>
A good tent with similar side door/vestibule advantages and roomy enough for two is the MEC Wanderer 2. Both people 
have a vestibule and entrance so it is very bearable even on a longer trip.

### Setting up a tent to withstand high winds
Virtually any tent can survive high winds if it is properly tied down. Unfortunately, 
most tents do not have proper tie-outs to make this possible. Also, many campers do not 
understand how to properly tie down their tents, even if it has adequate tie-outs. Just 
shoving stakes in the ground, without thinking about the wind forces on the tent, 
is inviting the tent to collapse if high winds occur.

Here are some tips to help a tent survive high winds.

Make sure all tie-outs on the tent fly connect to the tent poles underneath, not just to the tent fly fabric.

To properly brace a tent, the guy lines need to connect to the tent poles underneath the 
fly, and preferably to a junction of two or more poles. A guy line that attaches only 
to the tent fly fabric, and not to the poles underneath, might help prevent the tent 
from blowing away in high winds, but it's not going to add much structural strength to 
the tent frame. This is one reason why sewn-in tie-outs are better than the various 
mechanical gismos that people use to create tie-outs on the tent fly. With a sewn-in 
tie-out, you can add velcro tabs on the back that you can wrap around the tent poles and 
create a secure mechanical connection between the tie-out and the poles. All quality 
tents I know of are built this way, so use this method to add tie-outs to your tent fly 
if you are using an inexpensive tent that isn't build this way. Also, when you are adding 
tie-outs to your tent, be sure to put them relatively high up the sides of the tent -- about 1/2 to 2/3 of 
the way up from the ground to the top. This will enable you to brace the upper part of 
the tent that catches the most wind. Again, if you examine quality tents, that's where you will find their tie-outs.

Each guy line to the tent should be perpendicular to the tent pole arc or as close to that as practical.

Once a tent has tie-outs that all connect through the fly to the poles, the issue then 
becomes proper use of the tie-outs to brace the tent frame. The strongest bracing 
comes from guy lines that are perpendicular to the tent pole arc. Of course, that 
will mean tying some guy lines upward as well as outward (e.g., to a nearby tree), 
but this will provide the strongest possible bracing to the tent frame. If you have 
nothing tall and strong to tie to, and you have no choice but to stake your guy lines 
to the ground, then at least make the guy lines as long as you can, to make the angle 
between the guy line and the pole as close to perpendicular as practical. And if you 
want truly bombproof guy lines, use two stakes on each guy line, driven into the ground in a "^" formation.

Use two guy lines on each tie-out and tie them so that they are perpendicular to 
each other as well as perpendicular to the tent pole arc.

With two guy lines on each tie-out, tied perpendicular to each other and to the tent 
pole arc, you will brace each tie-out in all three dimensions: the pole will brace 
the tie-out along the pole's axis, while the two guy lines will brace the tie-out along 
the other two perpendicular axes. This three-dimensional bracing adds amazing strength to 
the tent frame. Likewise, if you must stake the guy lines to the ground, stake them so 
they make a 90-degree "V" at the tie-out.

Make sure the tent has a to-the-ground rain fly and extend it if it does not.

Tents that have short rain flies invite the wind to grab them and tear them up. If your 
tent does not have a to-the-ground rain fly, then fix the problem by stitching a nylon 
extension onto the bottom edge of the fly. Use coated nylon and you will add both wind 
protection and rain protection.

Using the above tips, almost any tent -- even a cheap fibreglass-poled dime-store tent -- can withstand high wind. 
The key is to add extra tie-outs, guy lines and stakes to help brace the tent frame.



## Bivy Sacks and Bicycle Touring
A bivy sack is a small, one person shelter which is more like a sleeping bag cover rather than a tent. 
In a lot of ways it is just a big waterproof tube you stick your sleeping bag, mattress and yourself into.

If you want to travel light and fast, they deserve consideration.

**Pros:**

Lighter weight than a conventional tent. They often weigh in at less than 3 pounds.  
Smaller ‘footprint’ – you can set it up in much less ground space than a tent.  
Ease of setup

**Cons:**

They don’t have much extra room in them for changing clothes, reading or other activities.  
Sometimes they don't 'breath' very well and can get clammy inside.  
You, and only you, are going to fit in one. It's solo only (but read below).

### Opinions about bivy sacks

As I said above, Bivies can be great for when you want to be in and out without a lot of fussing around with a tent. 
In mountaineering we used them as emergency shelters or for base camp use when at elevation. I have used them in 
deplorable conditions, but slept very well at 15 degrees and 50-75 MPH winds at a wind chill of brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr .... **so they work....**

To set one up, you pretty much just have to roll it out or unfold it, stick in your sleeping bag, crawl in and you are sleeping.

Some come with a small pole that you use near your head to keep the material off your face and to 
get rid of that claustrophobic feeling. Others also have a small pole that does the same thing around your feet.

The material used in these can make a critical difference in what sort of environments they are 
best suited for. The Bibler Tripod Bivy, for example, uses a **waterproof membrane material** that 
is second to none in performance. That's great at 15,000 feet where the air is cold and dry, 
but not so great (generally speaking) down at normal altitudes or in wet, rainy or humid conditions. 
The humidity and your own breath from condensation can have you swimming inside the thing pretty quick.

Outdoor Research makes a very popular bivy and were the first to use the pole design around 
your head. They also make a version (or at least they used to) for two people. But at that 
point you might want to consider a tent given the limitations on space and the additional 
weight. Sorry, but you can't mate two regular sized bivies together like you can with sleeping bags...

The pole around your head makes a huge difference to a lot of people, and I would recommend 
that you consider these types as your first choice. Yes, they tend to cost more but the 
extra headroom and ventilation more than make up for it. **You've worked too hard today for a 
crummy nights sleep, don't you think?**

Bivies with poles usually have a feature that allows you to open them up at the top to 
enjoy the stars or to get some extra air. Good ones also have **bug netting**, and you can 
stow it away when not needed..

The length of the zipper and its' placement can be something of an issue - at least it was 
for me. Some bivy sacks have no zipper at all really, you just have to sort of wiggle your 
way into them from the opening at the top. Others have zippers that run down the side and 
help with getting in and out quite a bit.

The ones without zippers are lighter and simpler, but getting into one, with a sleeping bag 
already inside, sitting on the ground (wet, snow) is not my idea of fun.

Some even come with arm holes so you can **sit in the thing and do camp chores**, all the while 
being warm and toasty and protected from the elements.

Remember when shopping for a bivy that the required length isn't just your own height, but 
you need to include extra for the foot section of your sleeping bag as well as plenty of 
room for your head. There's nothing quite as unpleasant as trying to sleep in a space that is 4 inches too small.

Some bivies have enough room inside for your sleeping pad, while others have attachments that 
let you hook them onto the mattress. I always just used the bivy on top of the mattress, but 
that was always in snow. Rolling off wasn't such a big problem because the whole setup kind of 
made a depression in the snow anyway which tended to hold me on top. On normal ground, rolling 
off and going Thump! in the middle of the night might be a problem for some.

### Cost

You can pay as much as you like for a bivy sack. I've seen cheaper versions for as little as $50, 
and the top end (such as the Bibler) pushing the $300 range.
My Bicycle Touring recommendations

I'm not an expert on cycle touring, but given what I DO know about it and my experience with bivy 
sacks, I would make the following recommendations when making a purchase:

Get a bivy with a pole for added head space.
The longer the zipper for ease of entry, the better. Yes, this adds to the "more things that can 
leak, break or go wrong" factor, but well worth it.
When in doubt, get the bigger size.
If I *had* to recommend one brand of bivy, I would go with the Outdoor Research Advanced or 
Deluxe Bivy. You really can't go wrong with the design and quality of construction.
Outdoor research and Mountain Equipment Co-op (MEC) are two web sites that have examples of bivy sacks.
