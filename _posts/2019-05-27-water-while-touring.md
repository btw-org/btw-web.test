## Hydration
Everyone knows the necessity of drinking plenty of water before, during and after exercising 
for an extended period of time. Bike touring is no different: your body needs water to work 
properly. Failing to drink enough water while on tour might temporarily hinder your performance 
and intellectual capacities such as your level of alertness and ability to make quick decisions.

There are various ways to carry water, the most common being the use of water bottles attached 
to your bike frame for easy access. Some prefer to carry water in a special pack from which they 
can drink using a long tube (e.g. Camelback). Since wearing anything on your back while biking 
is rarely comfortable, most people stick to bottles but I have also seen people placing their 
pack in their handlebar or on a frame bag while mounting their straw on their handlebar for easy access.

Water, however, is not the only thing being lost through sweat while touring. Ever noticed how 
salty your body gets after sports? We exude **a fair amount of salt** when sweating. This salt is 
necessary to the good functioning of the body notably by helping the transmission of nerve 
influx to your muscles and organs. This is why sports drinks such as Gatorade, PowerAde and 
the like contain a lot of water and a little bit of salt. They also contain some sugar for 
taste and energy. Similarly, there are packets of electrolytes on the market to help people 
suffering from dehydration; these essentially contain **salt and a bit of potassium**. 
Talking about potassium, bananas contain a lot of potassium and are cheap, tasty and full of good sugar… 
they are, in my opinion, the ultimate cyclist’s snack.

You can make your own sport drink by diluting your favourite fruit juice in the same amount of water and 
by adding a very little pinch of salt. One of my favourite recipe consist of pressing a lemon in a bottle 
of water (about 750ml), adding just enough sugar for the mixture to taste good (usually two tea spoons) 
and a pinch of salt. I usually tour with one bottle containing such a mixture and one containing water. 
I then let my body dictates its own preference along the way.

Most of the time, you’ll find places to refill your bottle on the road: fountains, public washrooms, 
restaurants… you can even knock at someone’s door and ask politely for water. Sometimes however, you 
might have to cross areas where **water will be inaccessible for more than a day.** In such case, 
you’ll need to carry more water. The problem with water is that it adds a lot of weight and pack poorly. 
One way to solve this problem is to carry extra bottles in your panniers. Another way is to buy **foldable 
water containers** such as Platipus and MSR Dromedary bags; they take less space when folded and can be 
strapped to your racks or placed at the bottom of your pannier for more stability.

Sometimes, you might also have access to streams or lakes. In many cases you can drink from these sources 
but the **water needs to be treated**. There are many options available in most outdoor stores. There are, 
for example, filters available which eliminate most of the unwanted pathogens from the water as well as 
iodine tablets which when added to the water kill harmful bacteria. Boiling water is perhaps one of the 
most effective ways of purifying water but is much less efficient in higher altitude where water boils 
at lower temperature. Some people even make their own purifying system using bleach. In any case, make 
sure you are using a method that is effective under the condition you are faced with.

One of the problem with carrying water on your bike during those hot summer days is that the **water gets 
warm easily**… tepid water is supposed to be assimilated faster by the body but lets admit it, we also 
drink to feel the refreshing effect of ingesting a cool liquid. Sometimes, the though of drinking tepid 
water is so unappealing that we prefer skipping an otherwise needed drink. There are a few tricks to help 
you keep your beverage cold for longer period: some people add ice and others use insulated bottles. 
Since you can rarely find ice when on tour and that insulated bottles only work for a few hours, 
I believe nature offers us a better method for keeping the content of our bottles cool.

It is the evaporation of our sweat that keeps us cool in the summer. You can use the same principle 
to **keep the content of your bottles cool**. The trick is very simple and only requires an old cotton 
sock and an elastic band. By placing a sock around your bottle and securing it there with an elastic 
band, you have created a perfect envelop that should keep moisture near the bottle. Then, you simply 
have to fill your bottle and pour a bit more water on the sock. Once the sock is wet, all you need to 
do is to pedal so that the wind helps at evaporating slowly the moisture; this should cool down the 
bottle and its content. Many are extremely sceptical of this very simple solution; to them 
I simply say: try it and judge afterward!


## Water bottles

Water is a very important item to carry with you during a bicycle touring adventure. 
One of the ways to carry water is to use water bottles.

Most people seem to purchase water bottles from their local bike shop but there are different options available too.

The bottles available at your local bike shop generally work well and last for quite a long time. 
Usually there are two sizes available. The smallest size (the middle bottle in the picture) 
holds approximately 500 ml of water. A larger size is usually available as well that holds approximately 750 ml of liquid. 
The left most bottle is about the same size to give you a comparison although it isn't an example 
of a typical bike shop bottle. As long as I can safely place the bottle on the bike then I usually carry the larger 750 ml bottles.

The left most bottle is my preferred bicycle touring water bottle. It's made by Nalgene and has 
several features that I like. First of all it holds approximately 750 ml of water so by using the 
bottle I give up nothing compared to the large bike shop bottles. Secondly it features a **protective 
cap cover** that keeps mud, road kill and other icky items of that nature away from the place where 
I drink from the bottle. The bottle is made of a very tough material and the last key feature that 
I like to mention is that the bottle features a very wide mouth making cleaning easier and allowing 
my water filter to attach directly to the water bottle.

The right most bottle in the picture is a large bottle of bottled water like you might find in gas 
stations, grocery stores and other food locations. Topeak is an example of one company that makes a 
water bottle holder that allows you to carry **even larger water bottles on your bike**. I actually own a 
Topeak water bottle holder but I haven't yet used it on a tour so I can't comment on how well it works. 
I do like the idea of being able to carry 3.750 litres of water in water bottle cages rather then the 2.250 
litres I've used in the past (calculated using two 1.5 litre bottles and one 750 ml bottle).

Many touring specific bikes have the ability to carry three water bottle cages. Two are the standard 
cages located inside the triangular part of the frame. The third cage hangs below the downtube 
requiring caution to make sure that the wheel does not catch on the bottle causing steering issues.

Of course there are other ways to carry water including **water bladders** and **hydration packs**. 


## Water filters
Back when I was a sea cadet I took a survival at sea course. During that course some statistics 
came up that I admit to vaguely remembering. They went something like a person can survive with out 
food for close to a month. The same person can survive without water for around a week and if they 
drink salt water then they will last three or four days. These memories could be wrong and they should 
be double-checked if their accuracy is important for your endeavour.

What is known is that **running out of water at any time during a bicycle tour really sucks!** 
Few things are worst then having a dry mouth, parched lips and feeling a burning need for water 
while your body overheats from lack of proper hydration. A number of studies in books and on the 
web have pointed out how little you need be suffering from a lack of water before your body really 
starts feeling the effects.

A similar problem is what happens when you drink poor quality or polluted water. You can experience 
misery in many terrible ways including the "runs", stomach cramps, sickness and of course unplanned 
bowel movements. Just the kind of adventure you always wanted to experience during a bicycle touring adventure eh?

While all of these are things that could be inadvertantly experienced I suspect that they are much 
more problematic when stealth camping where a water supply of known quality might not always be available.

Now that I've talked about all of the above I will admit that so far **I have carried enough water** on 
tour to not yet run out and I have also been lucky enough to not seem to find bad water supplies that 
cause severe effects. I have unfortunately experienced the joys of a quick run into the woods when 
nature calls. (grin).

For my Round Lake Huron tour I decided to invest in a **water filter**. My thinking was that 
I would be doing some stealth camping especially in the more remote sections of my tour and 
I wanted to make sure that I had sufficient water supplies of as good quality water as possible.

The water filter I selected will screw directly to the top of the wide mouth Nalogene water bottles 
that I use making refilling easy. The Nalogene bottles also have a handy cap that's easy to drink from 
while protecting the part that goes in my mouth from contact with road debris.

It is very possible to tour without a water filter and in fact I have experienced at least ten tours 
without having one along including my trip around Lake Erie.

The water filter does indeed add weight to the load but it also gives me piece of mind. I heard many 
stories about "beaver fever" from Cross Canada cyclists who knew someone or experienced firsthand the 
effects of running out of water in a remote area and replenishing by drinking water directly from the 
nearby lakes, rivers and streams. With the water filter I wasn't worried about drinking water if I had 
run out at any time during my adventure and that's a great position to be in while experiencing a 
great bicycle tour!
