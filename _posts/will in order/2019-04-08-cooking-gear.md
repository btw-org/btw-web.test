### Touring with a MSR Dragonfly stove
I currently use a MSR Dragonfly stove when I go bicycle touring. I've had this stove for four years now and I've used it during all of my bicycle touring adventures.

Although heavier then a soda-can stove, this stove is lightweight compared to many other stoves. It is also very compact and easy to pack up so that it can fit inside a small to medium sized cooking pot. When deployed the stove provides a sturdy cooking platform.

This stove burns at least six different kinds of fuels so the possibility of actually running out of fuel while touring is greatly reduced. In actual practice in order to switch fuels you also have to switch fuel needles. As a result and due to the easy availability of Naptha everywhere I've toured I haven't yet tried burning a different fuel.

Boiling a pot of water is an operation that takes very little time with the DragonFly. One disadvantage of running at high power is the loud "afterburner-like" noise of the stove. It is possible to simmer using this stove since it also includes a simmer control that allows you to dramatically reduce the amount of heat that you are producing.

You will need a fuel bottle for this device. The fuel pump is a mainly plastic piece of hardware that you use to pressurize the fuel bottle.

MSR also offers spare parts and repair kits. I carry one with me that I have thus far never had to use. I also have a spare fuel pump in my "leave at home, mail if needed" box in case the pump should experience a failure.

This stove has served me well during my bicycle touring adventures and despite my recent fascination with soda can stoves I suspect that this one will continue to travel with me for quite some time.

Doug Pfrang submitted the following additional comments about the MSR Dragonfly based on his personal experience with the stove.

"Older Dragonfly stoves have been known to fail where the burner connects to its pivot rod -- the braze fails and the burner separates from the pivot rod and base. The manufacturer has responded by improving the design so the braze is much larger and stronger. If you have an older stove, keep an eye on the braze. If it fails, the manufacturer will repair it free of charge.

The weakest link in the stove is the plastic pump, especially its o-rings. If the o-rings leak while the stove is in use, the pump could easily catch on fire. To minimize problems, keep the o-rings lubricated with a non-petroleum mineral oil, and periodically replace them using the manufacturer's "annual maintenance kit." If they leak, immediately turn off the stove and replace them."

## Windscreens, paper clips and clothespins
Sometimes it's really the simple things that make it all easier. For years I've been fiddling with the windscreen on my MSR stove to try to make it stay together nicely when in use while also allowing me to put it away quickly and easily.

During one tour my friend Bob suggested that I use a simple paperclip to hold the pieces together. I've since tried this and the larger clips work well.

An alternative that I used successfully during my Lake Ontario tour was to use a metal clothespin. This proved to be a great solution for me but please use a metal one that isn't covered by plastic! (grin)

A really simple solution to a mildly irritating problem!

A simple clothespin made all the difference. This picture is from before the plastic burned off! (grin)

## Canister Stoves

Another type of stove that is can be used for bicycle tours is the canister type of stove. Steven Arbogast uses one when he tours. He describes these stoves in the next section.

"One type of camping stove available is the canister fuel variety. Instead of having a fuel bottle, the stoves run on compressed butane/isobutane/propane mixtures. There is no loose fuel to handle, and these stoves could not be easier to use. While not as cheap or light as some alcohol stoves, nor as heavy or expensive as most liquid fuel (white gas) stoves, the primary selling point for canister stoves is the ease of use and light weight.

The model I own is the Micron, made by Primus. Other manufacturers include MSR, Snowpeak, Gaz and Coleman's Exponent line. The Micron weighs as little as 3.5 oz/109g, and packs down very small, making it a good choice for bike touring. The piezo electric igniter makes lighting the burner as easy as can be. Just turn on the gas and flick a switch to make a spark and I have a flame. Some stoves do not have the piezo igniters but rely on matches or lighters instead.

The one large drawback of canister stoves is their performance in cold conditions. Because they rely on fuel pressure provided by the compressed gas, temperatures around 32/0deg f/c (or below) can cause a drop in performance. This drop is amplified if the canister is nearing empty. To prevent the drop-off it is possible to keep the cannister warmer, such as in your sleeping bag. I have also just cupped my hands cupped around the fuel to warm it up.

A canister stove.

The fuel costs me about $4.00US, and I have gotten nearly a week of breakfast and dinner duty for one out of a single 225g canister. The heat output is similar to the stove at home, and it is similarly adjustable. I carry the stove (folded up) and a fuel canister inside of my 1 liter pot. This gives me a small and lightweight cooking package. The canisters are available from severel different maufacturers and can be purchased at most stores where backpacking gear is sold."

## Camp Stove Olympics
During my last tour I was touring with a buddy who had just completed building a soda or pepsi can stove. For a bit of fun and to enliven the supper preparation we decided to have what we laughingly called the Camp Stove Olympics.

Bob Vanderhoek contributed the picture of his homemade camp stove.

This is a Do It Yourself soda can stove. Notice the handmade windscreen and pot holder. The two paperclips inside the leftmost can are used to hold the windscreen together. There are actually four stoves in the picture. By building your own stove you have a variety of options available to you.



Results
Cost

The Homemade pepsi can stove is much, much cheaper then the MSR Dragonfly. Bob estimates $20 CDN for the first stove and since material is left over several more stoves can be made with what remains making the cost even lower on a per stove basis.

The MSR Dragonfly cost at least $120 CDN when I purchased it two years ago. I need to look up current prices but it will be more especially since I also purchased a maintenance kit and spare parts. The Pepsi can stove can simply be recycled when it wears out.

Winner is the Pepsi Can stove.

Noise

This might seem like a strange factor but not if you happen to be trying to stealth camp or simply type up your daily journal entry while supper is prepared. The Dragonfly is noisy. In fact I often think of a high performance fighter aircrafts afterburner when the Dragonfly is in full gear. In contrast the Pepsi Can stove is blessfully silent.

Winner is the Pepsi Can stove.

Flexibility

The MSR Dragonfly that I have can run on six or eight different fuels including diesel and automotive fuel. Having said that the reality is that I usually only run on white gas. Still it's nice to know that if I really needed to then I have options.

The Pepsi can stove runs on alcohol and only alcohol. This fuel is readily available in at least North America (think Lock de-icer fluid). The only other possible issue could be cold weather temperature performance. This last topic needs more research.

Two other advantages of the Pepsi Can stove is the ability to rebuild on demand with very cost effective, off the shelf parts and the ability to modify the design to meet your personal needs. Want a longer average burn time then build a slightly higher stove. Want bigger burner holes? Go ahead and create them!

Winner is the Pepsi Can stove although cold weather performance needs more testing.

Weight

The MSR Dragonfly is a heavier stove then the pepsi can stove without question. In fact Bob was carrying three stoves with him without any weight penalty that I could tell.

Winner is the Pepsi Can stove.

Ease of setup

This test determined how quickly a stove could be setup from stowed away inside pots etc to being ready for a match to be applied.

The MSR Dragonfly has a pressurized fuel bottle. Of course it gets that way when someone uses the built in pump to increase pressure. This improves performance BUT from discussions with several backpackers, canoeists and cyclists who have used the stove the pump is easily broken.

When the gas bottle is already pressurized then the Dragonfly can be setup in about the same amount of time as the Pepsi Can stove.

Winner is the Pepsi Can stove.

Convenience/Packability

When you can pack multiple stoves in the same space and without weight penalty as the competition then I believe the convenience factor is already won. Why?

Imagine setting up camp and wanting to cook two, three or four items in parallel? Bob would have been able to do this with the Pepsi can stove while I would have been stuck following a sequential path with the Dragonfly.

Winner is the Pepsi Can stove.

Fastest to boil water vigorously

This test was performed by having the stoves fueled and setup ready for a match to be used.

Both stoves had to bring an identical amount of water to a boil as quickly as possible using the highest performance settings available to each one.

The Dragonfly was two to three times faster (think 5 minutes versus 10 minutes) compared to the Pepsi can stove.

This sounds impressive until I apply a reality check that not all people would buy into. I often type in my daily journal entries while cooking dinner so I normally use the Dragonfly on a much lower setting.

A higher temperature test needs to be performed with the Pepsi can stove to determine if the cold outside temperatures during the test played a significant role.

Winner is the MSR Dragonfly from an outright performance perspective.

Cool down time

Both stoves seemed to take about the same amount of time to cool down for safe stow-away.

Overall winner?

You decide. After all it's up to you to decide what stove works best for your needs. I have to admit that I was surprised and impressed with how well the Pepsi Can stoves work especially when you factor in the cost.


## Zero Cost Cookset
This article is just one of a series of articles that Fritz has written for Bicycle Touring 101. I encourage you to check out his other articles in this section and his wonderful web site where he has more plans for stoves and accessories.
https://web.archive.org/web/20110705122923/http://www.kruegerservices.com/fritz/osp/

Regardless of how any stove was originally made, whether it was purchased in a store or made at home from plans and ideas seen elsewhere please always remember to use caution! Flames burn and a bad burn could go a long way towards ending a bicycle touring adventure far too early!

Fritz came up with the Zero Cost Cookset as a way to allow people to try bicycle touring, including cooking, without needing to spend a lot of money getting started.

In reality the usefulness of this concept doesn't end there. It is often difficult to transport stoves and their fuel to the starting location of a tour when you have to fly to get there due to security rules. With this design you could easily pick up a bottle of fuel and rapidly build your own stove from readily available parts and very simple tools. When your tour is complete then you would simply dispose of the stove for recycling or perhaps give it to another touring cyclist that you met at the end of your tour.

To get started take a small pot from your kitchen cupboard. A 5-1/2"(14cm) diameter is good. You can use a larger pot if you need to.

The next article in this series shows you how to create a Plain and Simple Stove (PASS) from readily available parts using a minimum of tools..

#### Zero Cost Cookset - Making a windscreen
Fritz Krueger is a bicycle tourist who also has a passion for researching, designing and building homemade camp stoves. He has contributed several articles about Camp Stoves to Bicycle Touring 101. This particular article is part of his Zero Cost Cookset series.

Regardless of how any stove was originally made, whether it was purchased in a store or made at home from plans and ideas seen elsewhere please always remember to use caution! Flames burn and a bad burn could go a long way towards ending a bicycle touring adventure far too early!


This article contains instructions to build a fully functional windscreen. A windscreen will make your stove much more efficient at cooking food and allow you to have much greater success even when the wind is blowing strongly.

 

Step One:
https://web.archive.org/web/20110702001548im_/http://bicycletouring101.com/getimage.php?w=180&o=no&i=FritzKruegerWindscreenSides.jpg
ş Obtaining the windscreen material.
Cut the tops and bottoms off of 3 or 4 pop cans. Cut the center sections into rectangles 3-1/4" x 7-3/4". Round off the corners and lightly sand the edges so that they are not sharp. Refer to the left picture.

Step Two:
https://web.archive.org/web/20110702001548im_/http://bicycletouring101.com/getimage.php?w=180&o=no&i=FritzKruegerCircleTracing.jpg
ş Tracing a circle.
Trace a circle around your pot onto a sheet of paper. The circle should be 1/4" wider than your pot in each direction. Refer to the picture to the right.

 
Step Three:
https://web.archive.org/web/20110702001548im_/http://bicycletouring101.com/getimage.php?w=180&o=no&i=FritzKruegerWindscreenCompleted.jpg
ş Staple the sides together. 
Stand the rectangles up on the circle. Overlap them and staple them together. Fasten the final overlap with 2 paperclips instead of stapling. Use a hole-punch to punch holes along the bottom edge. Refer to the picture to the left.

At this point you have a functional windscreen. In the next article instructions are provided that will allow you to modify your windscreen so that it also becomes a pot holder as well.

#### Zero Cost Cookset - Fuel Issues and possible upgrades
Fritz Krueger is a bicycle tourist who also has a passion for researching, designing and building homemade camp stoves. He has contributed several articles about Camp Stoves to Bicycle Touring 101. This particular article is part of his Zero Cost Cookset series.

Regardless of how any stove was originally made, whether it was purchased in a store or made at home from plans and ideas seen elsewhere please always remember to use caution! Flames burn and a bad burn could go a long way towards ending a bicycle touring adventure far too early!

This article continues the Zero Cost cookset series with a discussion of the fuel that you will need to use and some of the fuel related items that you should consider.

Alcohol fuel stoves use denatured alcohol as their fuel. Denatured alcohol is very readily available wherever paint products are sold. This includes stores like Walmart, Home Depot, and hardware stores. You can also use methyl alcohol gasoline de-icer which is sold at gas station convenience stores.

Carrying your fuel is another consideration. Depending on the length of your tour you may want to carry different amounts of fuel with you. One option is to carry a very small amount of fuel using something the size of the squeeze bottle shown in the picture. To carry more fuel you might want to consider a bottle the size of this hydrogen peroxide container.

When it comes time to actually place the fuel in the stove a measuring device that allows you to pour in a set amount while keeping your fingers dry is quite useful. Containers like this can often be found at drug stores. An example of one product that tends to have one is Pepto Bismo.

ş A simple tool to make measuring out fuel easier.


Possible upgrades

This cookset is so cheap, is it worthless? No, these items are fully functional. With the exception of the pot from your kitchen, the equipment is very light and compact and therefore well-suited for bicycle touring.

If you try and like the cookset, there are two upgrades I recommend. Replace your kitchen pot with a decent camping pot. You want something lighter and without a big handle so that it will pack compactly. Upgrade the pot stand from coat hanger wire. A hardware cloth pot stand is sturdier and can be packed in your pot.

The next article in this series contains the operating instructions for your newly created stove.

#### Zero Cost Cookset - Operating Instructions for Alcohol Fuel Stoves

Fuel

This stove is designed to burn denatured alcohol. You can find this in the paint thinner section of hardware or building supply stores. The containers are sometimes also labeled "Marine Stove Fuel". Please note that other paint thinners and stove fuels are explosive and should not be used in this stove. An acceptable alternative fuel is isopropyl alcohol; however, it will deposit a lot of soot on the bottom of your pot.

Caution

The flame produced by this stove is fainter than a kitchen natural gas stove. This stove’s flame is invisible in bright sunlight. Be very cautious in bright light conditions. It is best to learn to use your stove in low-light conditions.

Using your stove

Add fuel to your stove. Always use a fuel dispenser to fuel your stove. One ounce of fuel will last about 10 minutes. It takes about 6 minutes to boil 2 cups of water.
Light your stove with a match or lighter.
Extinguishing your stove: it is fine to just let the stove burn itself out. You can stop it sooner by covering it with an empty soup can. In an emergency douse any burning alcohol with water. If the water itself is already hot or boiling then obviously use some caution moving the water too!

## Gutter Spike Stove
There are lots of camp stoves of all sorts, some good and some that leave much to be desired but one thing they all have in common is a rather high price tag for what you get. Sterno or canned heat has been around for years, mostly found under chafing dishes in buffet lines any more. During WW-II and Korea, it was a quick way for soldiers to heat up C rations or boil water for instant coffee.

It's ideal for the solo bicycle tourist in that it's cheap, easy to carry and does an adequate job. Each can costs about a dollar and will burn for about three hours. While not as hot as some of the pressure camp stoves, what it lacks in power it makes up for in simplicity.

Basically all you need is a can of fuel, three gutter spikes (big nails about 8" long) and some aluminum foil or even a split pop can as a wind shield. The shield will concentrate the heat under the pan and make it much more efficient. Great for heating canned or dehydrated foods. Find a level spot with nothing on the ground to catch fire, set the can level and stick the three gutter spikes in the ground around it. They hold it in place and form the base for your pan. The best height is about an inch higher than the top of the can. Wrap a piece of aluminum foil about 3/4 of the way around it, leaving the top about half an inch below the tops of the nails for venting.

Some of the cans of heat have a wick to light while others are simply open at the top. Both seem to produce about the same amount of heat but those with a wick are safer in that they can't spill the fluid should they be turned over.

A side benefit to this type of stove is the gutter spikes can be used asspare tent stakes.

## Utensils including a knife, fork and spoon
If you intend to cook any meals at all or even pick up the materials for a meal at a deli or grocery store then you will likely want to bring along some basic utensils.

Like so many other things it is possible to pick from an enormous selection. During my first tour I carried a metal fork, knife and spoon that I picked up from a department store's camping section. At the time I was quite pleased with my selection and to be honest the utensils worked out well.

By the time I set out to go around Lake Erie my needs were still the same but I caught the weight bug somewhere along the way. As a result I picked up some light weight utensils made out of a type of plastic called Lexan. The new utensils worked well for my needs, are significantly lighter then the old ones and seem to clean up just a touch easier.

There are many types of utensils you can take along on your bicycle tour from a complete set containing a knife, fork and spoon all the way to a single utensil that can act as all three at the same time.

At this point if I had to pick up another set I would look for utensils that are lightweight, durable, flame and heat resistant along with being easy to keep clean.

Jamie Arlen provided the following suggestion about an easy way to carry your utensils so that the utensils, your gear and even yourself are protected from the sharp points often present on these items.

"In many many years of camping, one thing that has always stood out as an excellent idea for the kitchen is one that my parents learned about in a campground in Ontario.

As part of your kitchen gear, you'll find that you've got a variety of utensils - even in an ultralight camping kitchen.  Many of these utensils are sharp or sharpish.  To protect the utensils, make a protective pouch for them using a piece of soft absorbent cloth (in the olden days it was a tea-towel, these days I'd suggest a synthetic camp towel).   Lay the cloth down and fold it in thirds, the bottom piece gets tacked down and sewn with slots for each utensil.  The top folds over to protect the utensils and the entire package is rolled up to eliminate clinking and to protect the bag that the utensils are stored in."

Maxime Lachance added the following comment(s):

Maxime Lachance suggested updating this article to include chopsticks providing the following quote as the reasoning behind her suggestion.

"I suggest adding a comment about the versatility of chopsticks while camping:

Chopsticks are very cheap, pack easily and are lightweight
You can eat almost everything with them (including the ramen noodles that many cyclists eat while on tour)
You can use them to mix and turn almost everything in your frying pan
You can get new ones in almost every chinese buffet that you find along the road (and there are a lot of them in North America)"

## Dealing with Bears in the woods
From time to time a question appears on touring mailing lists, newsgroups and forums about how best to handle bears. This particular question is one that has occupied my mind from time to time as well.

When the question is posted a number of replies usually appear talking about hanging your food from trees, separating your cooking/eating area from your sleeping area and often a reminder about never eating in your tent.

A very good resource that has so far served me well is a book called "backcountry Bear Basics" by Dave Smith. The ISBN number is 0-89886-500-x. This book covers all of the topics mentioned above as well as many more.

After reading the book you will have a much better understanding of bears, their habits and their environment. The book also covers many of the "myths" that have arisen over the years and an actual discussion around the real number of bear attacks etc that have been experienced. An entire chapter also discusses guns and pepper spray.

Cooking and food storage are another topic that receives a lot of attention. In addition to the normal directions on how to hang bags from trees the book also discusses the concept of cold food instead of cooking and covers off Bear Resistant containers as well which is nice to see since I use a Bear Keg myself when touring.

So far my bear encounters have been limited to sighting bears crossing roads etc while I'm on the bike. I would like to believe that this book has gone a long way towards helping that to remain the case!

### Bear Resistant Food Containers

During my Round Lake Huron tour a sneaky raccoon managed to requisition my tastiest freeze-dried meal. Other than that one encounter I haven't had any other animal problems but as I learn more about Stealth camping I've been thinking about the whole issue of safe food storage.

Many people almost instantly think of hanging your food from a tree and I also thought of this but a bit more research showed that this is definitely not an effective technique in some areas where the bears have learned how to find and utilize hanging food. Indeed bear resistant food containers are often recommended or REQUIRED when camping in certain national parks in the United States. Without this kind of container you are not allowed to camp, it's as easy as that.

These containers are designed to be lightweight, tough, a diameter that a bear can not easily get its jaws around and have a smooth exterior that prevents the bear from getting a good grip. There are no protruding surfaces at all. To open the container you have to use a screw driver or a coin to turn the two or three screws that hold the lid on.

The dimensions of these devices can make packing tricky. I plan to place mine on top of the rear rack. Since the outside surface is smooth I will be using a carrying bag or a cargo net to keep it attached.

I am by no means an expert at keeping yourself bear-safe while camping in the woods. I have done a tremendous amount of reading about the topic and from this reading I know that bear attacks are relatively rare and provided that you take some precautions like eating your meal away from your camp site, keeping food or food-smelly clothes away from your camping spot and putting your food container well away from your camp site then bears or other wild animals shouldn't be a problem.

Many animals are attracted to smells from soap, shampoo, shaving creams and other smelly body products like deodorant. These items will also be stored in the container.

I recently purchased one of these devices to improve my food security and personal safety in the woods while camping out. Once I return from a trial tour I will update this page with information on how well it worked out for me. Even if it only prevents another lousy night's sleep from a raccoon eating a tasty snack nearby then it will probably be worth it.

There are several different bear resistant containers available including the Counter Assault Bear Keg and the Garcia Machine Backpacker's Cache Model 812. I decided to purchase the Counter Assault Bear Keg along with a carrying bag.

Now that I actually have the device it's become apparent that I may be able to attach the device to my rear rack easily without needing the actual bag.

This page will be updated following my next long tour to reveal how well it worked for me.
