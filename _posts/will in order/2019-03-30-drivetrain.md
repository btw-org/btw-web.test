ÅŸ My current drivetrain on my Trek 520 has much lower then stock gearing leading to a happy and comfortable tour for me!


## Selecting the best gearing for your touring bicycle

A very common question on most bicycle touring related mailing lists and newsgroups concerns selecting the proper gearing for a bicycle touring bike.

There are really two answers that are almost instantly heard when the question is asked.

1) You need to select the gearing that works best for you

2) Most stock touring bikes come with gearing that is too high for loaded/self contained touring although that same gearing generally appeals to club riders to whom the majority of these bikes are sold.

I look at it this way. If I am going down a hill and the speed reaches the point where I can no longer pedal then I have a rest and coast down the hill or I turn the pedals slowly to keep blood flowing in my legs.

On the other hand if I am climbing a hill and the resistance is too strong to continue without a lower gear then I have very few options short of a long walk uphill pushing the bike.

I've never heard anyone complain about having too low of a gear available but I've certainly heard people talk about having gears that were too high!

** So what can you do if you have a bike with gearing that is too high? **
The first thing I did was to find the gear that I liked to use the most on tour as well as the highest gear that I used regularily during that same tour. Of course to be a useful exercise it is important that your route include both ascents and descents and that you carry a normal touring load.

Here are some of the questions that I ask myself following the ride.

- Was my lowest gear low enough to allow me to spin my way uphill without causing a bad burn in my legs?

- Was my highest gear high enough to allow me to cruise down the road at a reasonable speed or was I always wishing for another higher gear?

- Was the spacing between the various gears good or did the test reveal large jumps that were quite irritating?

- Would I be comfortable with this gearing over the course of a hilly eight hour ride?

Once I have this information then I have the basis to decide if I really do need to make changes.

Whenever I am considering gear changes I like to use something called a Gear Calculator. The one I use the most is located at Sheldon Brown's excellent web site ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20150202044612/http://sheldonbrown.com/gears/) . With the gear calculator it is easy to determine how big of a change in gearing that you are considering.

There are many ways to view the gearing information. Although somewhat dated I tend to use Gear Inches as my unit of measurement. Gear inches were originally determined by measuring the circumference of the large wheel on the old pennyfarthings so the number that you see in the calculated result shows the pennyfarthing wheel equivalent for that gear.

When using the calculator I need to enter information about the crank length, tire size, front cranks and the rear cassette. Here are the answers I would have provided for my original Trek 520.

Crank length: 170mm
Tire Size: 700c X 32
Front cranks: 52/42/30
Rear cassette: Shimano (as), nine speed, 11-32

This yields the following results:
(Each column represents the gearing for that particular crank so in this example column one is for the 52 front, column two is 42 and column three is 30).

127.6	  103.1 	73.6
108.0 	87.2  	62.3
93.6	  75.6  	54.0
82.6	  66.7  	47.6
70.2  	56.7  	40.5
61.0	  49.3  	35.2
54.0	  43.6  	31.2
46.8	  37.8	  27.0
41.3  	33.4  	23.8


What this chart tells you is that my highest gear is 127.6 gear inches while my lowest gear is 23.8 gear inches. In practical terms I rarely used even the 93.6 gear inch gear let alone the much higher ones. I also found myself wishing for lower gears on steep hills. The hills were still doable but not as easily as I wanted! Another thing to note is that the difference between gears ranged from 13 to 18 percent meaning that some gears had a much bigger jump then others making it harder to decide to go up a gear or not.

I have made modifications to my gearing since picking up the bike so my answers are different now:

Crank length: 170mm
Tire Size: 700c X 35
Front cranks: 42/32/22
Rear cassette: Cyclotouriste-13, nine speed, 13-34

This yields the following results:


87.8	  66.9	  46.0
76.1	  58.0	  39.8
67.1	  51.1	  35.2
60.1  	45.8	  31.5
54.3  	41.4	  28.5
47.5  	36.2  	24.9
42.3  	32.2	  22.1
38.0  	29.0	  19.9
33.6  	25.6  	17.6

In this example the highest gear is 87.8 gear inches while the lowest is 17.6. I can't recall ever wishing for a higher gear and I've certainly come to appreciate the three lower gears that I have to choose from compared to before. As an added bonous the gears are much closer together too with only a 10 to 15 percent difference between gears. This means that often I discover that my speed has increased slightly and I can easily switch to a higher gear. Over the course of a day this can make a tremendous difference as you fine tune your pedaling and gain that little extra bit of performance and comfort.

When you compare the numbers for these two setups the following things should be visible. The highest gear has dropped significantly along with the lowest gear. The spacing between gears is also much more even so no gears suffer from large jumps. This makes it quite easy to shift up or down a gear to try to obtain the optimal gearing for the terrain that you are going through.

I also use this bike for everyday commuting. In that mode the loads are lower and I can easily push my highest gears. My current gear range is such that I seldom wish for one more higher gear. About the only time is when I am racing a buddy and feel the need for a slightly harder push to drop them behind.

**Economics**
The problem with the setup I've shown here is that I did it the expensive way. I basically accepted the stock bike as is the day of purchase and then gradually upgraded components as time passed and my knowledge level of what I needed increased. This means that I gradually upgraded the rear cassette, front deraileur, front cranks and bottom bracket. I ended up with a very good setup for me but it cost money. If I could go back and do it again I would specify the lower gearing upfront assuming that I planned to do fully loaded/self-contained touring.

**Has the quality of my tour improved?**

The quality of my touring experience has definately improved. With my extremely low gearing I haven't found a hill yet that I can not eventually climb even with a full load of stuff. Not only can I climb the hills but after doing so my legs still feel energetic.

For me making the gearing changes was definately the right move and one that I wish I had done the day I purchased the bike. Since I already knew at that point that fully loaded/self-contained touring was in my future it would have been the most cost effective way to do it.


## Drive train friction points check list
Demetri Kolokotronis crossed the United States by bicycle in 2003 starting from the Pacific Ocean and ending on the coast of the Atlantic. His bicycle tour was a long one in terms of both distance and time. He started out in early summer and finished in late fall. I can still recall reading about how cold it was in the morning towards the end.

He submitted this checklist of drivetrain components for inclusion on this site. His list is meant to showcase the number of components of the drive train that could be suffering from increased friction thereby robbing you of your forward motion.

I have often been guilty in the past of almost taking the drivetrain for granted. When I saw Demetri's list I realised how many adjustment or friction points that there really are.

Here is the list:

- Front and rear derailleur limit screw adjustments
- Rear derailleur pulleys lubrication
- Rear derailleur angle adjustment
- Closeness of front derailleur cage
- Parallelism of front derailleur cage
- Arc of front derailleur cage follow chainwheel
- Shifter cables integrity
- Shifter cables length
- Shifter cables tautness
- Shifter cables routing
- Shifter cables lubrication
- Shifter tightness
- Shifter lubrication (when applicable)
- Bottom bracket spindle correct length
- Bottom bracket spindle bolt tightness
- Chain type (width, etc)
- Chain length
- Chain lubrication
- Chain wear
- Rear axle fore-aft placement
- Rear axle angle in rear dropouts (up, down, front, back)
- Freewheel cog wear
- Freewheel cog orientation (front, back)
- Freewheel tightness
- Freewheel lubrication
- Chainwheel wear
- Chainwheel bolts tightness


It's a long list and it gives plenty of room for thought on one of those days when you are pushing against a relentless headwind and wondering how you could improve the efficiency to get that extra little bit of forward motion.

Don't let the apparent complexity overwhelm you. Most of these items are easy to adjust yourself with a bit of practice. Alternatively if you don't feel up to it then any good bicycle shop should be able to look at this list and help you out!


## Protecting your derailleur from an accidental twist
Derailleurs hangers are a relatively fragile part on a touring bike. Although it appears from the recent survey that damage occurs infrequently when it does occur it can really mess up your ability to shift rear gears successfully.

One advantage of bar end shifters is that you can easily switch from indexed to friction mode and manually change the gears that way making this problem something you can often live with until you reach a shop.

Another alternative is to install a derailleur protection device like the one shown here in the picture. They are commonly used by off road single track riders who crash more frequently while riding over technical terrain.

If you typically tour on the road then I suspect that the most likely cause of a bent hanger will be accidentally dropping your bike on it's side after leaning it against a tree or possibly having an extremely bad wipeout on the open road. Both occurrences are hopefully relatively rare for the average cyclist.

Installing this device is simple. Remove the current wheel nut that your quick release attaches to. Replace it with the device and presto you have a deraileur protection device.

The picture on this page shows the device with a bit of dirt on it. The dirt came from a hard, helmet smashing wipeout that occured while riding off road at high speed. Despite wearing helmets for a long time this represented the first time my head actually hit the ground. Thanks to the helmet and the protective device on the derailleur the bike and I both came out fine!

Although I do have this device installed on my off road bike I haven't installed one on the touring bike yet.

 ÅŸ After a helmet smashing day of off road riding the protector has done it's job well! The protector is actually the device that has the dirt on it.
 
 ## Differences in crank length
 
 Recently while riding my fixed-gear bicycle I experimented with crank length. With a fixed-gear you have only one gear and you have to pedal constantly all the time. This means that when you go around a corner you have to pedal and as a consequence it is possible to hit the pedal on the ground during the turn. Hitting a pedal on the ground can have some major impact on your cycling day so it's something you try to avoid as much as possible.

My first set of cranks on this bike were 175 mm in length while the new set are 165 mm. Even though the testing was performed on a fixed-gear bike it was useful because it gave me a chance to really see first hand the difference that 10 mm makes when riding a bicycle regardless of the type.

The 175 mm cranks had the advantage of giving me more leverage when climbing hills. It seemed to be easier to go uphill as long as I maintained forward momentum. When descending I found that my hips ended up moving further and pedaling smooth circles was much harder.

The 165 mm cranks made pedaling fast downhill incredibly easy in comparison. On flat ground I also found that I was pedaling more smoothly without moving my hips as much. Uphills were indeed harder but not to the point where it was impossible to ascend.

I should also mention that I've been told that knee problems might be caused by extreme angles when pushing the pedals. The 175 mm cranks put the knees at a much greater angle then do the 165 mm ones. I don't know how true this is but it is something worth looking into. It's likely also worth noting that many mountain bikes come with 175 mm cranks and people seem to use those successfully in more difficult terrain then that encountered during the average bicycle road tour.

A second opinion on the importance of using the right size crank can be found on Peter John White's web site in the "How to Fit a Bicycle" article ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20141008162240/http://www.peterwhitecycles.com/fitting.htm) , crank length section.

Peter's article is very interesting because he presents his personal experience with different crank lengths and includes a very useful formula that he believes works well for his customers.

In his article Peter recommends measuring the distance from the top of your femur to the bottom of your bare feet. Figure out what 18.5% of that measurement is to determine your optimal crank arm size.

I haven't performed this calculation yet but once I do so I will post the result here for comparison purposes.

So how does this relate to my bicycle touring bike?

My touring bike has 170 mm cranks so it's setup mid-way between the two cranks I've used giving me slightly more leverage when climbing while also giving me the benefit of being able to spin easier circles while pedaling.

I intend to continue to experiment with this further. Please feel free to contact me if you have your own viewpoint on this topic.

## Selecting the best pedals for bicycle touring

There are many, many types of pedals out that can be used with a bike so it's not surprising that from time to time a question about the best pedals to use for touring will appear.

Let's talk a bit about just some of the types of pedals that are available.

**Platforms**

These pedals are likely very similar to the first type of pedals you ever used on a bike. As you may recall from child hood memories you can use any footwear (including no shoes at all if you are willing to take a big risk). This type of pedal is very versatile for that reason alone.

For touring I can see this type of pedal being incredibly useful if you would like to wear "normal" shoes or if you need to wear winter boots to accomodate cold temperatures.

These pedals can often be paired with a set of Power Grips ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20141220022736/http://powergrips.com/) to give you many of the benefits of clipless pedals while allowing you to keep wearing normal footwear.

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20141220022736im_/http://www.bicycletouring101.com/getimage.php?w=295&o=no&i=JamiePedalsPlatStrap.jpg)
ÅŸ Platform pedal on the left and an old pedal with straps on the right.

**Straps**

Not surprisingly straps were originally used by racers who were looking for that extra bit of performance. To gain it they would strap their feet to the pedals. With tight straps your shoes are well connected and it is possible to pull up while pedaling through the upstoke resulting in better performance. In touring terms this type of extra performance could prove quite useful when climbing hills provided that you have the straps tight.

Most people, including me when I used straps, would often leave the straps loose to allow for a quick and easy removal of the foot from the pedal especially when commuting. Of course this negates some of the benefit of straps by taking away the ability to pull effectively on the upstroke. Other benefits of straps remained like the ability of the straps to help keep your feet on the pedals when hitting an unexpected bump.


**Clipless**
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20141220022736im_/http://www.bicycletouring101.com/getimage.php?w=295&o=no&i=JamiePedalsClipless.jpg)
ÅŸ Time ATAC, Shimano SPD with surrounding platform and a stainless steel Eggbeater.

With this kind of pedal you are actually connecting a cleat in the bottom of a special cycling shoe directly to the pedal itself. This leaves you with a very strong connection to the pedal that allows you to transfer maximum power to the drivetrain. Disconnecting is easy once you've practiced a bit. There are many different types of clipless pedals including ones called SPD, EggBeaters, Frogs, Time etc and they all have slightly different ways of connecting and disconnecting the cleats to the pedals.

Often a simple turn of the foot to the left or right will be all that's needed to remove the cleat from the pedal. It is not uncommon to experience a very slow speed fall in your first few days of using clipless when you stop at a traffic light and forget how to unclip until you reach the ground. A little bit of training and thought can often go a long way to prevent a reoccurance of the problem.

When riding clipless pedals I often feel like I have another lower gear on the bike. I seem to be able to ride further and faster with the same amount of effort. Of course some of this is likely to be related to the stiffer soles of the cycling shoes that do a much better job of projecting my muscular force to the drivetrain but some also comes from the direct connection to the bike.

**What types have I used?**
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20141220022736im_/http://www.bicycletouring101.com/getimage.php?w=295&o=no&i=JamieEggBeaterGreaseGun.jpg)
ÅŸ This picture shows a set of replacement cleats for the Eggbeater pedals as well as the grease gun I use for simple pedal maintenance.

I commuted for many years using normal pedals and of course all of my exploration expeditions when I was a kid happened with these pedals too so I can safely say that these pedals do work. They are also easy to find at almost any bike shop should you break one on tour.

When I started riding offroad I ended up moving towards straps to help keep my feet on the pedals while moving over rough terrain. The straps worked well but I found it mildly irritating to have to always be aware of the need to sneak my foot into the strap when starting off whether it was while riding in the woods or while getting started after a traffic light.

Eventually I moved on to clipless pedals for the easier connection and much better power transfer and I haven't looked back. I've used SPD, Time ATAC and Eggbeaters since then. Today I use Eggbeaters on all of my bikes. The biggest reason for this is that I prefer this kind of clipless pedal while mountain biking especially in mud, ice and snow. I also like the fact that the newer versions of these pedals allow for a lot of self-maintenance making a problem much more preventable and recoverable. The last reason for using them on all of my bikes is simply convenience. WIth one pedal type I can wear a pair of shoes with any of my bikes.

I did have a problem on a tour with Eggbeater pedals once. This particular set of pedals was the very first version of Eggbeaters that were sold. It was not possible to easily maintain the pedals and they broke while I was pedaling around Lake Erie. It is worth noting that these same pedals were used to ride through an entire winter of snow, ice and salt as well as two summers of riding before the failure. The newer versions of the pedal that I purchased to replace the original set are much better since they allow for easy maintenance.

**My recommendation?**

At the end of the day you have to find a pedal that works well for you and that helps you to accomplish your goals. For me I've found that I really enjoy using Eggbeaters with a pair of Shimano sandals while touring. Although the shoes are not as stiff as some they work well for letting my feet also enjoy some sunshine and fresh air while I pedal down country roads.

I enjoy the Shimano sandals because I can walk in them like they are normal shoes, pair them with a set of goretex socks for wet weather and of course they work nicely on the bike too.


## Replacing cleats
I think all of us keep memories of our first experiences riding clipless pedals for a long time. Usually those memories include a slightly fond memory of a slow motion sideways fall when you couldn't get unclipped as well as memories of very stiff cleats that were harder to disengage.

It's only natural to resist swapping out your old, worn-out cleats with new ones when having those memories. After all as the cleats wore in it became easier to unclip making the chances of another fall much, much less.

Still all good things come to an end and eventually the cleats should be replaced with new ones. For me the moment always comes when I start finding it harder to stay clipped in to my Eggbeater pedals. Generally this is a much greater problem when riding offroad since having a foot unclip at the wrong time can be quite dramatic and not really much fun!

In the event that a cleat is totally destroyed the impact doesn't seem to be too bad. You lose the opportunity to pull up on the upstroke and your feet won't feel as connected to the pedals but that's about it. You can usually still pedal the bike using the bottom of your shoe to propell you along. It won't be as comfortable but it will work.

To prevent cleat problems I usually just swap out the cleats prior to a long tour. This seems to really reduce the likelihood of a problem and if the old cleats weren't fully used up then I can always switch them to another set of shoes for offroad biking etc.

When you do get around to replacing the cleats remember to lightly grease the threads of the screws before reinserting them into the bottom of the shoe. The light grease seems to go a long way towards preventing the screws from seizing so that you can easily remove them later.

ÅŸ The silver coloured cleats are old and due for replacement while the brass coloured ones are brand new. Compare the shapes of the two sets. They should be identical but material has gradually been worn away.
